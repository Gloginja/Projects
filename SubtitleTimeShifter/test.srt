1
00:01:01.921000 --> 00:01:04.424000
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:04.883000 --> 00:01:05.967000
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:06.426000 --> 00:01:07.927000
Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:08.386000 --> 00:01:10.013000
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:10.472000 --> 00:01:12.474000
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:10.657000 --> 00:02:11.783000
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:12.242000 --> 00:02:13.535000
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:13.993000 --> 00:02:15.578000
I'll bet this.

9
00:02:16.037000 --> 00:02:16.621000
Aah!

10
00:02:17.080000 --> 00:02:18.248000
Ha ha ha!

11
00:02:18.706000 --> 00:02:19.749000
So, where are we going?

12
00:02:20.208000 --> 00:02:21.501000
It's a surprise,
baby.

13
00:02:21.960000 --> 00:02:23.253000
Yeah, I like surprises.

14
00:02:23.711000 --> 00:02:26.214000
Yeah.

15
00:02:28.675000 --> 00:02:31.428000
Whoo!
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:31.886000 --> 00:02:34.514000
What the fuck
are we doing here?

17
00:02:36.474000 --> 00:02:38.518000
Whoo! Look at all that.

18
00:02:38.977000 --> 00:02:41.271000
Ha ha ha!

19
00:02:41.729000 --> 00:02:43.648000
What the fuck is that?

20
00:02:49.487000 --> 00:02:50.071000
Hey!

21
00:02:53.658000 --> 00:02:55.618000
What did you just say?

22
00:03:34.532000 --> 00:03:35.533000
Wow.

23
00:03:49.798000 --> 00:03:51.841000
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

24
00:03:52.300000 --> 00:03:54.385000
Unh! Aan!

25
00:04:03.061000 --> 00:04:04.270000
Whoo!

26
00:04:04.729000 --> 00:04:06.189000
All right.

27
00:04:06.648000 --> 00:04:08.400000
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:13.071000 --> 00:04:14.364000
Yeah.

29
00:04:14.823000 --> 00:04:16.241000
Whoo!

30
00:04:27.585000 --> 00:04:30.463000
Ha ha ha!

31
00:04:30.922000 --> 00:04:32.757000
What's happening?

32
00:04:33.216000 --> 00:04:34.217000
Unh!

33
00:04:39.597000 --> 00:04:40.640000
Whoa!

34
00:04:41.099000 --> 00:04:42.767000
Aan.

35
00:04:48.189000 --> 00:04:49.190000
Fuck.

36
00:04:59.033000 --> 00:05:02.370000
Fuck. I need a drink.

37
00:05:27.145000 --> 00:05:28.730000
Ahh!

38
00:05:49.667000 --> 00:05:51.461000
No! No!

39
00:05:54.923000 --> 00:05:56.132000
Aah!

40
00:05:56.591000 --> 00:05:58.968000
What's wrong, baby?

41
00:05:59.427000 --> 00:06:01.930000
Aah! Aah!

42
00:06:02.388000 --> 00:06:04.182000
No! No!

43
00:06:05.975000 --> 00:06:07.519000
Aah! No!

44
00:06:09.604000 --> 00:06:10.605000
Ha ha ha!

45
00:06:55.316000 --> 00:06:56.317000
Is that him?

46
00:06:56.776000 --> 00:06:58.194000
Jesus, that's him.

47
00:06:58.653000 --> 00:07:01.448000
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

48
00:07:22.719000 --> 00:07:24.679000
Come on, daywalker!

49
00:07:34.773000 --> 00:07:36.649000
Aah!

50
00:07:44.783000 --> 00:07:47.327000
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

51
00:07:47.786000 --> 00:07:48.787000
Unh!

52
00:08:03.885000 --> 00:08:05.637000
Aah!

53
00:08:32.414000 --> 00:08:33.957000
Aah!

54
00:08:41.881000 --> 00:08:44.426000
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

55
00:08:44.884000 --> 00:08:45.718000
Fuck him up!

56
00:08:46.177000 --> 00:08:48.888000
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

57
00:08:49.347000 --> 00:08:51.558000
Whoo!

58
00:08:54.644000 --> 00:08:56.020000
Yaah!

59
00:09:36.686000 --> 00:09:40.815000
Yaah!

60
00:09:54.788000 --> 00:09:57.290000
Quinn...

61
00:09:57.749000 --> 00:10:00.877000
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

62
00:10:05.507000 --> 00:10:08.885000
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

63
00:10:11.888000 --> 00:10:13.807000
Give my regards to Frost.

64
00:10:17.060000 --> 00:10:19.395000
No! Please don't!

65
00:10:33.993000 --> 00:10:35.120000
Put him out.

66
00:10:35.578000 --> 00:10:37.580000
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

67
00:11:00.270000 --> 00:11:03.481000
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

68
00:11:03.940000 --> 00:11:05.567000
1, 2, 3.

69
00:11:10.572000 --> 00:11:12.949000
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

70
00:11:13.408000 --> 00:11:15.452000
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

71
00:11:15.910000 --> 00:11:19.289000
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

72
00:11:19.748000 --> 00:11:21.624000
That's very pretty.

73
00:11:34.679000 --> 00:11:35.722000
Did you check
the chem count?

74
00:11:36.181000 --> 00:11:37.766000
His sugar's
3times norm,

75
00:11:38.224000 --> 00:11:39.601000
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

76
00:11:40.059000 --> 00:11:43.188000
You took this
off a D.O. A?

77
00:11:43.646000 --> 00:11:45.482000
Yeah.

78
00:11:45.940000 --> 00:11:47.692000
But this doesn't
make any sense.

79
00:11:50.695000 --> 00:11:52.197000
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

80
00:11:52.655000 --> 00:11:53.782000
which is impossible.

81
00:11:54.240000 --> 00:11:57.494000
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

82
00:12:00.538000 --> 00:12:03.541000
OK, Curtis, it's3.00
in the morning...

83
00:12:04.000000 --> 00:12:05.001000
This is not a joke.

84
00:12:05.460000 --> 00:12:08.588000
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

85
00:12:09.047000 --> 00:12:11.591000
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

86
00:12:12.050000 --> 00:12:14.719000
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

87
00:12:21.267000 --> 00:12:24.521000
OK. Show me the body.

88
00:12:24.979000 --> 00:12:27.190000
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

89
00:12:27.649000 --> 00:12:30.193000
Done. We've had
that conversation.

90
00:12:34.072000 --> 00:12:35.990000
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

91
00:12:36.449000 --> 00:12:39.160000
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

92
00:12:40.954000 --> 00:12:44.040000
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

93
00:12:44.499000 --> 00:12:46.835000
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

94
00:12:47.293000 --> 00:12:48.253000
I'm going
to start the "Y"

95
00:12:48.711000 --> 00:12:50.130000
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

96
00:12:55.260000 --> 00:12:58.096000
Let me ask you
something.

97
00:12:58.555000 --> 00:13:00.140000
Honestly...

98
00:13:00.598000 --> 00:13:01.933000
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

99
00:13:05.603000 --> 00:13:07.021000
Sometimes.

100
00:13:09.107000 --> 00:13:10.984000
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

101
00:13:11.443000 --> 00:13:12.527000
Want to cut me
some slack here?

102
00:13:12.986000 --> 00:13:15.405000
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

103
00:13:15.864000 --> 00:13:16.448000
Look, Curtis...

104
00:13:16.906000 --> 00:13:18.032000
I'm trying.

105
00:13:18.491000 --> 00:13:19.492000
It's over.

106
00:13:28.501000 --> 00:13:31.504000
Yaah!

107
00:13:35.759000 --> 00:13:38.595000
Aah!

108
00:13:39.053000 --> 00:13:41.014000
Call security!

109
00:13:55.487000 --> 00:13:56.321000
Aah!

110
00:13:56.780000 --> 00:13:58.114000
Came back
to finish you off.

111
00:13:58.573000 --> 00:14:00.617000
Get out of my way,
you freak!

112
00:14:07.540000 --> 00:14:09.167000
Freeze!

113
00:14:10.877000 --> 00:14:14.047000
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

114
00:14:14.506000 --> 00:14:15.507000
Aah!
Aah!

115
00:14:17.133000 --> 00:14:20.053000
Yaah!

116
00:14:24.641000 --> 00:14:26.017000
Aah!

117
00:15:06.683000 --> 00:15:07.684000
Hey, you! Freeze!

118
00:15:18.236000 --> 00:15:19.154000
Aah!

119
00:15:19.612000 --> 00:15:20.196000
Aah!

120
00:15:20.655000 --> 00:15:22.490000
Aah!

121
00:15:26.202000 --> 00:15:26.828000
Freeze!

122
00:15:27.287000 --> 00:15:29.164000
Hold it right there!

123
00:15:37.756000 --> 00:15:39.758000
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:44.554000 --> 00:15:45.597000
My shoulder.

125
00:15:46.723000 --> 00:15:48.266000
It's dislocated.

126
00:15:50.977000 --> 00:15:52.729000
Aah!

127
00:15:59.569000 --> 00:16:00.570000
Uhh!

128
00:17:37.667000 --> 00:17:38.668000
Whistler.

129
00:17:42.046000 --> 00:17:43.840000
Whistler.

130
00:17:49.888000 --> 00:17:51.639000
Bringing home
strays now?

131
00:17:54.058000 --> 00:17:55.393000
She's been bitten.

132
00:17:59.898000 --> 00:18:01.066000
Should've
killed her, then.

133
00:18:01.524000 --> 00:18:03.109000
Yeah, I know.

134
00:18:05.612000 --> 00:18:07.155000
But I didn't.

135
00:18:13.995000 --> 00:18:15.914000
You watch her close.

136
00:18:16.372000 --> 00:18:19.167000
If she starts to turn,
You finish her off.

137
00:18:22.921000 --> 00:18:24.714000
Or I will.

138
00:18:27.675000 --> 00:18:28.676000
Uhh.

139
00:18:31.930000 --> 00:18:33.681000
She's border line.

140
00:18:35.391000 --> 00:18:39.145000
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

141
00:18:40.772000 --> 00:18:42.023000
Dr Karen Jenson,

142
00:18:42.482000 --> 00:18:44.192000
Listen close.

143
00:18:44.651000 --> 00:18:46.569000
I'm Going to inject you
with allium sativum...

144
00:18:47.028000 --> 00:18:48.488000
garlic.

145
00:18:48.947000 --> 00:18:50.824000
This is going
to hurt... a lot.

146
00:18:51.282000 --> 00:18:53.076000
It was Quinn.

147
00:18:53.535000 --> 00:18:55.495000
Frost's little
errand boy?

148
00:18:55.954000 --> 00:18:57.580000
You get
a lead on him?

149
00:18:58.039000 --> 00:18:58.706000
No.

150
00:18:59.165000 --> 00:19:01.751000
Too bad.

151
00:19:03.378000 --> 00:19:04.003000
Uhh!

152
00:19:04.462000 --> 00:19:05.505000
Hold her.

153
00:19:16.474000 --> 00:19:18.435000
I give her fifty-fifty

154
00:19:18.893000 --> 00:19:22.439000
if she makes it
through the night.

155
00:19:47.589000 --> 00:19:49.048000
Blade...

156
00:19:49.507000 --> 00:19:51.134000
the daywalker...

157
00:19:51.593000 --> 00:19:54.679000
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

158
00:19:57.640000 --> 00:19:59.559000
How many died?

159
00:20:00.018000 --> 00:20:02.062000
We don't have
an exact count.

160
00:20:02.520000 --> 00:20:04.355000
Apparently, he used
a lot of sliver.

161
00:20:04.814000 --> 00:20:06.024000
We're having
difficulty...

162
00:20:06.483000 --> 00:20:07.859000
Send in Frost.

163
00:20:16.785000 --> 00:20:17.786000
Deacon Frost.

164
00:20:21.873000 --> 00:20:24.250000
You can come in now.

165
00:20:57.325000 --> 00:20:59.285000
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

166
00:20:59.744000 --> 00:21:01.246000
Are they?

167
00:21:01.704000 --> 00:21:04.124000
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

168
00:21:04.582000 --> 00:21:05.375000
You know our policy.

169
00:21:05.834000 --> 00:21:07.585000
Your policy,
not mine.

170
00:21:08.044000 --> 00:21:09.712000
Our livelihood...

171
00:21:10.171000 --> 00:21:15.051000
depends on our ability
to blend in

172
00:21:15.510000 --> 00:21:17.470000
and our discretion.

173
00:21:17.929000 --> 00:21:21.266000
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

174
00:21:21.725000 --> 00:21:23.143000
We should be ruling
the humans,

175
00:21:23.601000 --> 00:21:24.310000
not running around

176
00:21:24.769000 --> 00:21:26.146000
making back-alley treaties
with them.

177
00:21:26.604000 --> 00:21:28.648000
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

178
00:21:29.107000 --> 00:21:29.691000
not our allies.

179
00:21:30.150000 --> 00:21:31.151000
You're out of line, Frost.

180
00:21:31.609000 --> 00:21:32.986000
Am I?

181
00:21:33.445000 --> 00:21:34.904000
Or maybe I'm just
The first to say out loud

182
00:21:35.363000 --> 00:21:36.448000
what we've
all been thinking.

183
00:21:36.906000 --> 00:21:38.324000
We have existed this way

184
00:21:38.783000 --> 00:21:41.119000
for thousands of years.

185
00:21:41.578000 --> 00:21:42.162000
Who are you

186
00:21:42.620000 --> 00:21:45.999000
to challenge our ways?

187
00:21:46.458000 --> 00:21:48.626000
You're not even
a pureblood.

188
00:21:52.088000 --> 00:21:53.339000
Like it matters.

189
00:21:54.674000 --> 00:21:58.094000
I was born a vampire,

190
00:21:58.553000 --> 00:22:01.723000
as was every other member
of this house,

191
00:22:02.182000 --> 00:22:03.433000
but you, Frost...

192
00:22:06.936000 --> 00:22:09.481000
you were merely turned.

193
00:22:11.775000 --> 00:22:13.234000
The world belongs to us,

194
00:22:13.693000 --> 00:22:15.653000
not the humans.

195
00:22:16.112000 --> 00:22:17.447000
You know that.

196
00:22:22.160000 --> 00:22:24.537000
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

197
00:22:24.996000 --> 00:22:27.123000
Well, uh...

198
00:22:27.582000 --> 00:22:29.084000
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

199
00:22:29.542000 --> 00:22:30.335000
We're having
difficulty...

200
00:22:30.794000 --> 00:22:31.586000
And have you made
the transfer to the...

201
00:22:32.045000 --> 00:22:33.046000
Gitano...

202
00:22:33.505000 --> 00:22:37.425000
you may wake upone day
and find yourself extinct.

203
00:23:10.625000 --> 00:23:11.626000
You're a week early.

204
00:23:12.085000 --> 00:23:13.503000
Yeah.

205
00:23:20.927000 --> 00:23:23.471000
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

206
00:23:26.725000 --> 00:23:29.310000
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

207
00:23:38.236000 --> 00:23:40.947000
You take care, all right?

208
00:25:24.843000 --> 00:25:27.178000
I must be getting
soft in my old age,

209
00:25:27.637000 --> 00:25:30.598000
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

210
00:25:31.057000 --> 00:25:33.226000
It was damn stupid of you.

211
00:25:33.685000 --> 00:25:35.645000
Might've lucked out,
though.

212
00:25:36.938000 --> 00:25:39.399000
I checked her background.

213
00:25:41.985000 --> 00:25:45.071000
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

214
00:25:46.156000 --> 00:25:49.159000
She might be useful to us.

215
00:25:49.617000 --> 00:25:50.994000
I doubt it.

216
00:25:52.579000 --> 00:25:54.080000
I'm serious.

217
00:25:54.539000 --> 00:25:55.999000
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

218
00:25:56.458000 --> 00:25:58.585000
She's onto something.

219
00:26:00.628000 --> 00:26:02.756000
I had to increase
the dose.

220
00:26:04.382000 --> 00:26:06.092000
It's over
50 milligrams now.

221
00:26:06.551000 --> 00:26:07.510000
That's getting
dangerous.

222
00:26:07.969000 --> 00:26:09.053000
Just do it,

223
00:26:09.512000 --> 00:26:11.264000
old man.

224
00:26:12.348000 --> 00:26:14.184000
Ahh.

225
00:26:24.360000 --> 00:26:25.612000
Uhh...

226
00:27:11.616000 --> 00:27:13.827000
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

227
00:27:15.829000 --> 00:27:17.080000
Who are you people?

228
00:27:17.539000 --> 00:27:18.665000
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

229
00:27:20.417000 --> 00:27:21.751000
You've met Blade.

230
00:27:37.892000 --> 00:27:39.394000
So, am I
a prisoner here?

231
00:27:41.438000 --> 00:27:43.022000
Not at all.

232
00:27:43.481000 --> 00:27:44.649000
We just had to take
certain precautions

233
00:27:45.108000 --> 00:27:47.110000
before we let you go.

234
00:27:47.569000 --> 00:27:49.237000
You got to understand,

235
00:27:49.696000 --> 00:27:50.655000
they're everywhere.

236
00:27:51.114000 --> 00:27:52.907000
Vampires...

237
00:27:53.366000 --> 00:27:54.784000
the Hominus nocturna.

238
00:27:56.244000 --> 00:27:57.412000
We hunt them, you see...

239
00:27:57.871000 --> 00:27:59.497000
moving from one city
to the next

240
00:27:59.956000 --> 00:28:01.166000
tracking
their migrations.

241
00:28:01.624000 --> 00:28:02.751000
They're hard to kill.

242
00:28:03.209000 --> 00:28:04.627000
They tend to regenerate.

243
00:28:05.086000 --> 00:28:06.171000
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

244
00:28:06.629000 --> 00:28:09.674000
Well, you already met
Mr Crispy at the hospital.

245
00:28:10.133000 --> 00:28:11.468000
What do you think?

246
00:28:13.511000 --> 00:28:15.054000
So, what do you use, then?

247
00:28:15.513000 --> 00:28:17.182000
Stakes? Crosses?

248
00:28:17.640000 --> 00:28:19.142000
Crosses don't do squat.

249
00:28:19.601000 --> 00:28:22.228000
Some of the legends
are true, though.

250
00:28:22.687000 --> 00:28:25.523000
Vampires are severely
allergic to sliver.

251
00:28:25.982000 --> 00:28:27.525000
Feed them garlic,

252
00:28:27.984000 --> 00:28:29.069000
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

253
00:28:29.527000 --> 00:28:31.071000
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

254
00:28:31.529000 --> 00:28:32.989000
ultraviolet rays.

255
00:28:33.448000 --> 00:28:36.117000
I got this sucker
running.

256
00:28:36.576000 --> 00:28:38.661000
You want to give it
a try tonight?

257
00:28:44.667000 --> 00:28:45.752000
It's still heavy.

258
00:28:47.378000 --> 00:28:48.546000
Well, you're so big.

259
00:28:51.049000 --> 00:28:52.258000
If you want to live
to see another day,

260
00:28:52.717000 --> 00:28:54.177000
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

261
00:28:54.636000 --> 00:28:56.638000
So where am I
supposed to go?

262
00:29:00.058000 --> 00:29:02.602000
You've been exposed to them.

263
00:29:03.061000 --> 00:29:06.398000
One way or another, somebody's
Going to take you out.

264
00:29:10.902000 --> 00:29:13.780000
There's a war going on
out there.

265
00:29:14.239000 --> 00:29:16.699000
Blade, myself,
a few others,

266
00:29:17.158000 --> 00:29:18.076000
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

267
00:29:18.535000 --> 00:29:19.160000
onto the streets.

268
00:29:20.745000 --> 00:29:21.746000
Sometimes,
people like yourself

269
00:29:22.205000 --> 00:29:24.624000
get caught
in the crossfire.

270
00:29:25.083000 --> 00:29:27.127000
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

271
00:29:27.585000 --> 00:29:30.046000
They own the police.

272
00:29:30.505000 --> 00:29:31.923000
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

273
00:29:32.382000 --> 00:29:34.259000
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

274
00:29:34.717000 --> 00:29:35.343000
and didn't know it...

275
00:29:35.802000 --> 00:29:37.595000
on the subway
or in a bar.

276
00:29:39.764000 --> 00:29:42.142000
So that's it?

277
00:29:42.600000 --> 00:29:45.603000
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

278
00:29:49.774000 --> 00:29:51.067000
Here.

279
00:29:51.526000 --> 00:29:52.861000
Vampire mace...

280
00:29:54.446000 --> 00:29:56.114000
sliver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

281
00:29:56.573000 --> 00:29:58.783000
You keep your eyes open.

282
00:29:59.242000 --> 00:30:01.119000
Be careful.

283
00:30:05.331000 --> 00:30:06.666000
One other thing...

284
00:30:07.917000 --> 00:30:10.170000
buy yourself a gun.

285
00:30:10.628000 --> 00:30:14.215000
If you start getting
sensitive to day light...

286
00:30:14.674000 --> 00:30:16.426000
if you find
you're thirsty

287
00:30:16.885000 --> 00:30:19.679000
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

288
00:30:20.138000 --> 00:30:21.222000
then I suggest
you take that gun

289
00:30:21.681000 --> 00:30:24.267000
and use it on yourself.

290
00:30:27.145000 --> 00:30:29.481000
Better that
than the alternative.

291
00:31:27.414000 --> 00:31:29.165000
You have been warned
before.

292
00:31:29.624000 --> 00:31:30.667000
These archives
are restricted

293
00:31:31.126000 --> 00:31:34.129000
to members
of the House of Erebus.

294
00:31:36.339000 --> 00:31:37.924000
You are wasting your time.

295
00:31:38.383000 --> 00:31:40.009000
It's a dead language.

296
00:31:40.468000 --> 00:31:44.222000
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

297
00:31:44.681000 --> 00:31:47.517000
You wouldn't even
Understand them.

298
00:31:49.728000 --> 00:31:50.562000
Damn it, Frost!

299
00:31:51.020000 --> 00:31:52.105000
I'm talking to you!

300
00:31:53.481000 --> 00:31:55.775000
Shh.

301
00:31:56.234000 --> 00:31:58.653000
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

302
00:32:00.780000 --> 00:32:01.906000
We're in a library.

303
00:32:02.365000 --> 00:32:03.366000
You don’t need
to shout.

304
00:32:04.868000 --> 00:32:07.746000
What are you up to,
Frost?

305
00:32:18.256000 --> 00:32:21.468000
What are you
Going to do, hmm?

306
00:32:26.014000 --> 00:32:27.015000
What?

307
00:32:32.645000 --> 00:32:34.105000
You bore me.

308
00:33:02.675000 --> 00:33:04.385000
Hey!

309
00:33:09.182000 --> 00:33:11.643000
Remember
what we told you.

310
00:33:12.102000 --> 00:33:13.937000
You keep your eyes open.

311
00:33:14.396000 --> 00:33:15.021000
They're everywhere.

312
00:33:17.232000 --> 00:33:18.817000
But it's daytime!

313
00:34:18.710000 --> 00:34:19.919000
How you doing?

314
00:35:38.540000 --> 00:35:40.166000
Hit here. Hey.

315
00:35:40.625000 --> 00:35:41.251000
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

316
00:35:41.709000 --> 00:35:43.128000
Whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, Hold on.

317
00:35:43.586000 --> 00:35:44.170000
Police officer.

318
00:35:44.629000 --> 00:35:45.463000
I'm sorry, OK?

319
00:35:45.922000 --> 00:35:47.048000
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

320
00:35:47.507000 --> 00:35:48.133000
The front door was open.

321
00:35:48.591000 --> 00:35:49.259000
What are you doing in here?

322
00:35:49.717000 --> 00:35:52.554000
I'm just here
on a routine check.

323
00:35:53.012000 --> 00:35:54.180000
Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,

324
00:35:54.639000 --> 00:35:55.640000
42nd precinct.

325
00:35:56.099000 --> 00:35:58.643000
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

326
00:35:59.102000 --> 00:36:00.437000
Yeah.

327
00:36:00.895000 --> 00:36:02.147000
Your co-workers
at the hospital

328
00:36:02.605000 --> 00:36:05.734000
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

329
00:36:06.192000 --> 00:36:07.235000
Are you OK?

330
00:36:07.694000 --> 00:36:10.780000
What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

331
00:36:12.490000 --> 00:36:13.324000
Curtis Webb?

332
00:36:13.783000 --> 00:36:15.285000
Um, he died.

333
00:36:16.619000 --> 00:36:17.328000
No, look,

334
00:36:17.787000 --> 00:36:18.913000
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

335
00:36:19.372000 --> 00:36:20.957000
Why?

336
00:36:21.416000 --> 00:36:24.627000
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

337
00:36:25.086000 --> 00:36:26.296000
Aah!

338
00:36:28.006000 --> 00:36:29.048000
Bitch!
What is it?

339
00:36:32.635000 --> 00:36:33.511000
What is this, garlic?

340
00:36:33.970000 --> 00:36:36.181000
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

341
00:36:36.639000 --> 00:36:38.099000
Vampires?

342
00:36:39.267000 --> 00:36:41.478000
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

343
00:36:43.521000 --> 00:36:44.814000
Nobody.

344
00:36:49.778000 --> 00:36:51.946000
He's a familiar...

345
00:36:52.405000 --> 00:36:54.074000
a vampire wannabe.

346
00:36:54.532000 --> 00:36:57.243000
If he's loyal enough

347
00:36:57.702000 --> 00:37:02.207000
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

348
00:37:02.665000 --> 00:37:04.667000
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

349
00:37:05.126000 --> 00:37:06.920000
Get over it.

350
00:37:11.549000 --> 00:37:12.592000
Is all that necessary?

351
00:37:17.555000 --> 00:37:19.432000
That's a glyph...

352
00:37:19.891000 --> 00:37:21.059000
a vampire cattle brand.

353
00:37:21.518000 --> 00:37:24.020000
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

354
00:37:24.479000 --> 00:37:26.147000
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

355
00:37:26.606000 --> 00:37:29.025000
then they have to answer
to his owner.

356
00:37:30.902000 --> 00:37:32.737000
Deacon Frost.

357
00:37:33.196000 --> 00:37:35.198000
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

358
00:37:35.657000 --> 00:37:37.033000
All right.

359
00:37:37.492000 --> 00:37:38.743000
Officer Krieger,

360
00:37:39.202000 --> 00:37:41.621000
you Going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

361
00:37:42.080000 --> 00:37:43.540000
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

362
00:37:43.998000 --> 00:37:44.707000
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

363
00:37:45.166000 --> 00:37:46.209000
You going
to rob me, too?

364
00:37:46.668000 --> 00:37:49.337000
How do you think that we
Fund this organization, huh?

365
00:37:49.796000 --> 00:37:53.299000
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

366
00:37:55.260000 --> 00:37:56.678000
It's fake.

367
00:37:59.472000 --> 00:38:00.557000
Well...

368
00:38:01.015000 --> 00:38:03.685000
looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

369
00:38:04.144000 --> 00:38:05.311000
Hillbarn Clinic.

370
00:38:05.770000 --> 00:38:06.813000
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

371
00:38:07.272000 --> 00:38:08.106000
Owned by vampires,

372
00:38:08.565000 --> 00:38:09.566000
and there's one
in every city.

373
00:38:10.024000 --> 00:38:11.151000
And they always deliver.

374
00:38:11.609000 --> 00:38:12.944000
So, where were you
taking it?

375
00:38:13.403000 --> 00:38:14.821000
I don't know what
you're talking... aah!

376
00:38:15.280000 --> 00:38:15.864000
Ooh!

377
00:38:16.322000 --> 00:38:18.199000
Look, take it easy.

378
00:38:18.658000 --> 00:38:20.368000
I'm only Going to ask you
one more time.

379
00:38:20.827000 --> 00:38:23.079000
Where were you taking it?

380
00:38:23.538000 --> 00:38:24.789000
Go fuck yourself.

381
00:38:25.248000 --> 00:38:26.708000
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

382
00:38:44.184000 --> 00:38:45.935000
You better wake up.

383
00:38:46.394000 --> 00:38:49.189000
The world you live in is
Just a sugar-coated topping.

384
00:38:49.647000 --> 00:38:51.733000
There is another world
beneath it...

385
00:38:52.192000 --> 00:38:52.942000
the real world.

386
00:38:53.401000 --> 00:38:54.194000
And if you want
to survive it,

387
00:38:54.652000 --> 00:38:57.572000
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

388
00:39:00.700000 --> 00:39:02.285000
Wait a minute.

389
00:39:02.744000 --> 00:39:03.328000
I'm coming with you.

390
00:39:03.787000 --> 00:39:04.788000
You're useless.

391
00:39:08.416000 --> 00:39:10.752000
I have to stick with you.

392
00:39:11.211000 --> 00:39:13.088000
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

393
00:39:13.546000 --> 00:39:15.215000
to find a cure for myself.

394
00:39:15.673000 --> 00:39:17.592000
There is no cure.

395
00:39:26.226000 --> 00:39:28.895000
He's not going
to come back.

396
00:39:30.146000 --> 00:39:31.648000
Nobody's that’s stupid.

397
00:39:32.107000 --> 00:39:34.943000
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

398
00:39:35.402000 --> 00:39:37.112000
you know what
it's capable of.

399
00:39:55.130000 --> 00:39:55.755000
It's Krieger.

400
00:39:56.214000 --> 00:39:57.090000
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

401
00:39:57.549000 --> 00:39:58.383000
Yes?

402
00:39:58.842000 --> 00:39:59.926000
Get me through.

403
00:40:03.680000 --> 00:40:05.765000
I got a delivery
in progress here,

404
00:40:06.224000 --> 00:40:07.517000
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

405
00:40:13.982000 --> 00:40:16.568000
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

406
00:40:37.297000 --> 00:40:39.549000
Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

407
00:40:40.008000 --> 00:40:41.509000
That's a vampire mark.

408
00:40:41.968000 --> 00:40:42.761000
It means that
there's a safe house

409
00:40:43.219000 --> 00:40:44.345000
around here somewhere...

410
00:40:44.804000 --> 00:40:47.348000
a place they can go
with donors coming.

411
00:40:47.807000 --> 00:40:49.642000
See the valets
over there?

412
00:40:50.101000 --> 00:40:51.269000
They're vampires.

413
00:40:51.728000 --> 00:40:53.813000
So is the doorman

414
00:40:54.272000 --> 00:40:56.775000
and the whore
on the corner.

415
00:40:57.233000 --> 00:40:58.568000
How can you tell?

416
00:40:59.027000 --> 00:41:00.779000
By the way they move...

417
00:41:01.237000 --> 00:41:02.238000
the way they smell.

418
00:41:02.697000 --> 00:41:03.698000
Psst.

419
00:41:06.743000 --> 00:41:08.369000
It's like a bad dream.

420
00:41:08.828000 --> 00:41:10.830000
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

421
00:41:11.289000 --> 00:41:12.123000
Like what?

422
00:41:12.582000 --> 00:41:13.958000
Like me.

423
00:41:15.627000 --> 00:41:17.420000
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

424
00:41:17.879000 --> 00:41:19.172000
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

425
00:41:19.631000 --> 00:41:21.174000
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

426
00:41:21.633000 --> 00:41:23.510000
You use a stake, sliver,
or sun light.

427
00:41:23.968000 --> 00:41:25.553000
You know how to use
one of these?

428
00:41:26.012000 --> 00:41:26.721000
Nope...

429
00:41:27.180000 --> 00:41:28.556000
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

430
00:41:29.015000 --> 00:41:30.183000
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...

431
00:41:30.642000 --> 00:41:31.476000
sliver hollow point
filled with garlic.

432
00:41:31.935000 --> 00:41:33.144000
You aim for the head
or the heart.

433
00:41:33.603000 --> 00:41:35.146000
Anything else is your ass.

434
00:41:37.649000 --> 00:41:39.109000
Do you have
an invitation?

435
00:42:09.931000 --> 00:42:11.182000
What you got?

436
00:42:28.366000 --> 00:42:29.743000
Kenji!

437
00:42:43.548000 --> 00:42:44.758000
Ohh!

438
00:42:45.216000 --> 00:42:46.259000
Where's the entrance?

439
00:42:46.718000 --> 00:42:47.427000
I can't tell you
that, man.

440
00:42:47.886000 --> 00:42:49.345000
Uhh!

441
00:42:51.848000 --> 00:42:53.224000
I'm Going to ask you
one more time.

442
00:42:53.683000 --> 00:42:55.143000
Where's the entrance?

443
00:42:55.602000 --> 00:42:57.437000
OK. OK.

444
00:42:58.521000 --> 00:43:00.523000
It's in the freezer.

445
00:43:09.783000 --> 00:43:11.034000
Come on, man!
I told you!

446
00:43:11.493000 --> 00:43:13.495000
It's in the fridge!

447
00:43:22.087000 --> 00:43:22.712000
OK.

448
00:43:23.171000 --> 00:43:24.964000
You give Frost
a message from me.

449
00:43:25.423000 --> 00:43:27.634000
You tell him it's
open season on suck heads.

450
00:44:10.427000 --> 00:44:13.054000
Some kind of archive.

451
00:44:16.933000 --> 00:44:19.102000
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

452
00:44:19.561000 --> 00:44:21.312000
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

453
00:44:21.771000 --> 00:44:23.815000
They've got their claws
into everything...

454
00:44:24.274000 --> 00:44:25.859000
politics, finance,
real estate.

455
00:44:26.317000 --> 00:44:29.320000
They already own
half of downtown.

456
00:44:52.635000 --> 00:44:54.220000
Frost throws a good party.

457
00:44:54.679000 --> 00:44:55.805000
Yeah...

458
00:44:56.264000 --> 00:44:57.891000
but where is he?

459
00:45:11.988000 --> 00:45:13.198000
Come on, baby.

460
00:45:22.707000 --> 00:45:25.335000
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

461
00:45:44.521000 --> 00:45:45.563000
Deacon,

462
00:45:46.022000 --> 00:45:48.733000
there's someone here
to see you.

463
00:45:51.236000 --> 00:45:53.988000
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

464
00:45:54.447000 --> 00:45:56.199000
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

465
00:45:56.658000 --> 00:45:58.243000
It's a mistake
Going to Pearl's.

466
00:45:58.701000 --> 00:46:00.829000
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

467
00:46:01.287000 --> 00:46:02.122000
I know you're
disappointed.

468
00:46:02.580000 --> 00:46:03.164000
Am I that
transparent?

469
00:46:03.623000 --> 00:46:04.207000
You want
to meet him?

470
00:46:04.666000 --> 00:46:05.250000
Yeah.

471
00:46:05.708000 --> 00:46:06.543000
I can get you guys
in with him,

472
00:46:07.001000 --> 00:46:08.253000
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

473
00:46:08.711000 --> 00:46:09.754000
Fuck.

474
00:46:10.213000 --> 00:46:11.005000
Aw, fuck. Frost.

475
00:46:11.464000 --> 00:46:12.465000
Hey.
Yeah.

476
00:46:13.550000 --> 00:46:15.009000
Deac. Deac.

477
00:46:15.468000 --> 00:46:17.262000
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

478
00:46:17.721000 --> 00:46:18.513000
They've been dying
to meet you.

479
00:46:18.972000 --> 00:46:19.597000
They are so psyched.

480
00:46:20.056000 --> 00:46:21.141000
Bad ass bitches.
They...

481
00:46:21.599000 --> 00:46:22.517000
Hi.

482
00:46:22.976000 --> 00:46:23.560000
Deac?

483
00:46:24.018000 --> 00:46:26.229000
Frost, it's about Blade.

484
00:46:26.688000 --> 00:46:27.647000
Aw, he's busy, you know?

485
00:46:28.106000 --> 00:46:29.482000
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

486
00:46:29.941000 --> 00:46:32.402000
Look, Frost,
this is important.

487
00:46:32.861000 --> 00:46:34.446000
Blade was waiting for me,

488
00:46:34.904000 --> 00:46:36.906000
using the girl as bait.

489
00:46:37.365000 --> 00:46:38.783000
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

490
00:46:39.242000 --> 00:46:39.993000
Shut up, bitch.

491
00:46:40.452000 --> 00:46:41.494000
I didn't know he was
Going to be there.

492
00:46:41.953000 --> 00:46:42.954000
It was a trap, see?

493
00:46:43.413000 --> 00:46:44.289000
But don't worry
About it.

494
00:46:44.748000 --> 00:46:46.374000
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

495
00:46:47.917000 --> 00:46:49.169000
Yeah!

496
00:46:56.009000 --> 00:46:57.177000
Whoo!

497
00:47:18.114000 --> 00:47:19.157000
Forget the girl.

498
00:47:19.616000 --> 00:47:20.575000
I want Blade.

499
00:47:21.034000 --> 00:47:22.452000
I know you do.

500
00:47:22.911000 --> 00:47:23.495000
You hear me, Quinn?

501
00:47:23.953000 --> 00:47:25.872000
I want him alive.

502
00:47:26.331000 --> 00:47:27.332000
What?

503
00:47:30.168000 --> 00:47:31.044000
Wait a minute, man.

504
00:47:31.503000 --> 00:47:33.296000
You want him alive?

505
00:47:36.299000 --> 00:47:37.842000
What's that smell?

506
00:47:40.804000 --> 00:47:42.639000
...image carefully, Frost.

507
00:47:43.098000 --> 00:47:48.103000
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

508
00:47:48.561000 --> 00:47:50.105000
Krieger, is that you?

509
00:47:50.563000 --> 00:47:51.356000
He... he's here!

510
00:47:51.815000 --> 00:47:52.399000
He's here!

511
00:47:52.857000 --> 00:47:54.150000
This must be Pearl,

512
00:47:54.609000 --> 00:47:55.193000
the record keeper.

513
00:47:57.487000 --> 00:47:59.239000
He's Going to kill me!

514
00:47:59.697000 --> 00:48:01.741000
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

515
00:48:02.200000 --> 00:48:03.451000
Pearl, you're history.

516
00:48:03.910000 --> 00:48:05.995000
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

517
00:48:06.454000 --> 00:48:07.789000
Frost.

518
00:48:08.248000 --> 00:48:09.791000
Ruthless bloodsucker.

519
00:48:10.250000 --> 00:48:11.042000
Congratulations, Blade.

520
00:48:11.501000 --> 00:48:12.585000
Frost.

521
00:48:13.044000 --> 00:48:14.212000
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

522
00:48:14.671000 --> 00:48:15.255000
I'm flattered.

523
00:48:15.714000 --> 00:48:17.132000
It'll pass.

524
00:48:19.634000 --> 00:48:20.218000
Fuck.

525
00:48:23.138000 --> 00:48:23.805000
What is that?

526
00:48:24.264000 --> 00:48:26.349000
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. lamp.

527
00:48:26.808000 --> 00:48:27.434000
We're gonna play

528
00:48:27.892000 --> 00:48:29.227000
a little game
of 20 questions.

529
00:48:29.686000 --> 00:48:30.979000
Depending on
how you answer,

530
00:48:31.438000 --> 00:48:33.940000
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

531
00:48:34.399000 --> 00:48:35.275000
What's that?

532
00:48:35.734000 --> 00:48:37.110000
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

533
00:48:37.569000 --> 00:48:39.112000
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

534
00:48:39.571000 --> 00:48:41.406000
Actually,
it's a video game.

535
00:48:52.667000 --> 00:48:53.877000
That must've hurt.

536
00:48:54.335000 --> 00:48:55.920000
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

537
00:48:56.379000 --> 00:48:57.213000
What prophecy?

538
00:48:57.672000 --> 00:48:59.132000
Oh, I'm not really sure.

539
00:48:59.591000 --> 00:49:01.301000
There are so many out...

540
00:49:15.440000 --> 00:49:18.985000
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

541
00:49:19.444000 --> 00:49:20.904000
Is that so?

542
00:49:21.362000 --> 00:49:24.032000
Well, that's
what Frost says.

543
00:49:24.491000 --> 00:49:25.742000
Then you won't mind me

544
00:49:26.201000 --> 00:49:28.620000
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

545
00:49:29.079000 --> 00:49:30.622000
If he moves, fry him.

546
00:49:33.958000 --> 00:49:34.542000
What's in here?

547
00:49:35.001000 --> 00:49:35.794000
Nothing.
It's a... a storeroom.

548
00:49:36.252000 --> 00:49:37.337000
But you’re
wasting your time.

549
00:49:37.796000 --> 00:49:39.422000
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

550
00:49:39.881000 --> 00:49:41.424000
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

551
00:49:41.883000 --> 00:49:42.967000
No!

552
00:50:05.615000 --> 00:50:06.950000
He moved.

553
00:50:37.772000 --> 00:50:39.983000
What is this?

554
00:50:41.568000 --> 00:50:42.485000
These are the pages

555
00:50:42.944000 --> 00:50:44.863000
from The Book
of Erebus,

556
00:50:45.321000 --> 00:50:46.698000
the Vampire Bible.

557
00:50:48.950000 --> 00:50:51.703000
It contains everything...

558
00:50:52.162000 --> 00:50:53.580000
their entire history.

559
00:50:54.831000 --> 00:50:58.376000
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

560
00:51:01.046000 --> 00:51:03.214000
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

561
00:51:03.673000 --> 00:51:04.883000
Shh!

562
00:51:42.128000 --> 00:51:43.630000
Give me your hand.

563
00:51:46.674000 --> 00:51:49.427000
Do you remember me?

564
00:52:07.612000 --> 00:52:09.197000
Give it to him!

565
00:52:25.046000 --> 00:52:25.964000
Hey! Hey!

566
00:52:26.423000 --> 00:52:28.133000
Nice one.

567
00:52:28.591000 --> 00:52:29.175000
Heh.

568
00:52:29.634000 --> 00:52:30.343000
Well, well, well.

569
00:52:30.802000 --> 00:52:32.595000
You took my arm, man.

570
00:52:33.054000 --> 00:52:34.556000
Remember?

571
00:52:35.014000 --> 00:52:36.391000
But it's cool.

572
00:52:36.850000 --> 00:52:38.893000
I gota new one.

573
00:52:40.520000 --> 00:52:42.272000
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

574
00:52:44.315000 --> 00:52:45.942000
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

575
00:52:46.401000 --> 00:52:48.027000
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

576
00:52:48.486000 --> 00:52:49.195000
Check it out.

577
00:52:49.654000 --> 00:52:51.448000
I've got his pig sticker.

578
00:52:51.906000 --> 00:52:53.241000
Ah ha ha ha...

579
00:52:53.700000 --> 00:52:54.409000
Ohh! Aah!

580
00:52:54.868000 --> 00:52:57.287000
You're a fuckup, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

581
00:52:58.913000 --> 00:52:59.664000
You're a fuckup!

582
00:53:00.123000 --> 00:53:01.291000
"I got his pig sticker!"

583
00:53:01.750000 --> 00:53:02.500000
Ohh.

584
00:53:02.959000 --> 00:53:05.003000
You're just
full of surprises,

585
00:53:05.462000 --> 00:53:06.755000
ain'tyou, chief?

586
00:53:15.013000 --> 00:53:17.015000
Stay with me, sweetness...

587
00:53:17.474000 --> 00:53:20.393000
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

588
00:53:22.645000 --> 00:53:24.439000
Ah, looky here.

589
00:53:26.483000 --> 00:53:27.984000
Sliver.

590
00:53:28.443000 --> 00:53:29.652000
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

591
00:53:30.111000 --> 00:53:31.780000
Probably costyou
a pretty penny.

592
00:53:32.238000 --> 00:53:36.367000
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

593
00:53:37.744000 --> 00:53:40.747000
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

594
00:53:45.001000 --> 00:53:47.253000
Come to think of it, Blade,

595
00:53:47.712000 --> 00:53:49.422000
I owe you one.

596
00:53:53.927000 --> 00:53:56.471000
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

597
00:53:58.139000 --> 00:53:59.516000
I owe you two.

598
00:54:02.602000 --> 00:54:04.687000
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

599
00:54:07.941000 --> 00:54:09.776000
I'm expecting company.

600
00:54:25.291000 --> 00:54:27.210000
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

601
00:54:27.669000 --> 00:54:28.878000
No! No guns!

602
00:54:31.005000 --> 00:54:32.507000
No! No! No!

603
00:54:39.264000 --> 00:54:40.598000
No! Fuckin' this way!

604
00:54:49.691000 --> 00:54:50.859000
Drop the guns!

605
00:54:51.317000 --> 00:54:52.235000
I need him!

606
00:54:52.694000 --> 00:54:54.904000
He wants Blade alive! Go!

607
00:54:59.409000 --> 00:55:00.869000
You've been
listening in the whole time?

608
00:55:01.327000 --> 00:55:02.287000
Keeping
radio contact.

609
00:55:02.746000 --> 00:55:05.582000
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

610
00:55:13.673000 --> 00:55:16.176000
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

611
00:55:16.634000 --> 00:55:18.803000
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

612
00:55:27.270000 --> 00:55:28.396000
Whistler!

613
00:55:28.855000 --> 00:55:30.482000
He can take care
of himself.

614
00:55:30.940000 --> 00:55:31.941000
Jump!

615
00:55:52.962000 --> 00:55:55.048000
Aah!

616
00:56:07.894000 --> 00:56:09.270000
Aah!

617
00:56:31.835000 --> 00:56:34.713000
Aah!

618
00:56:41.094000 --> 00:56:42.887000
Aah!

619
00:56:52.939000 --> 00:56:54.691000
What are you
gonna do?

620
00:56:55.775000 --> 00:56:57.152000
Oh, my God.

621
00:57:11.750000 --> 00:57:13.293000
What's wrong?

622
00:57:15.754000 --> 00:57:17.589000
It's dislocated.

623
00:57:18.048000 --> 00:57:19.340000
Ah!

624
00:57:19.799000 --> 00:57:21.301000
Let me help you.

625
00:57:24.345000 --> 00:57:25.889000
Aah!

626
00:57:32.937000 --> 00:57:33.855000
Let me give you...

627
00:57:34.314000 --> 00:57:36.066000
No! Getaway.

628
00:57:51.748000 --> 00:57:53.833000
You're one of them,
aren't you?

629
00:57:56.711000 --> 00:57:58.004000
No.

630
00:57:58.463000 --> 00:57:59.756000
I'm something else.

631
00:58:07.639000 --> 00:58:09.974000
I found him
when he was 13.

632
00:58:10.433000 --> 00:58:11.976000
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

633
00:58:12.435000 --> 00:58:13.978000
feedin' off
the homeless.

634
00:58:14.437000 --> 00:58:16.940000
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

635
00:58:17.399000 --> 00:58:20.985000
I took him
for a vampire at first.

636
00:58:21.444000 --> 00:58:22.821000
Almost killed him, too.

637
00:58:23.279000 --> 00:58:25.907000
Then I realized
what he was.

638
00:58:26.366000 --> 00:58:29.077000
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

639
00:58:29.536000 --> 00:58:30.954000
while she was pregnant.

640
00:58:31.413000 --> 00:58:33.915000
She died, but he lived.

641
00:58:34.374000 --> 00:58:35.125000
Unfortunately,

642
00:58:35.583000 --> 00:58:37.711000
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

643
00:58:38.169000 --> 00:58:41.673000
He can withstand
garlic, sliver,

644
00:58:42.132000 --> 00:58:43.258000
even sunlight,

645
00:58:43.717000 --> 00:58:45.301000
and he's got
their strength.

646
00:58:46.386000 --> 00:58:47.178000
This time tomorrow,

647
00:58:47.637000 --> 00:58:50.390000
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

648
00:58:52.350000 --> 00:58:54.436000
He still ages
like a human, though.

649
00:58:54.894000 --> 00:58:57.021000
See, vampires
age slower than us.

650
00:58:57.480000 --> 00:59:00.608000
Unfortunately...

651
00:59:01.067000 --> 00:59:02.986000
he also inherited
their thirst.

652
00:59:04.487000 --> 00:59:07.157000
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

653
00:59:07.615000 --> 00:59:09.868000
Time's runnin' out.

654
00:59:11.411000 --> 00:59:14.330000
His body's
startin' to reject it.

655
00:59:14.789000 --> 00:59:18.877000
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have falled.

656
00:59:23.506000 --> 00:59:25.300000
Why do you hunt them?

657
00:59:27.510000 --> 00:59:29.596000
I had a family once...

658
00:59:30.055000 --> 00:59:32.307000
wife and two daughters.

659
00:59:34.726000 --> 00:59:37.062000
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

660
00:59:37.520000 --> 00:59:38.521000
a vampire.

661
00:59:40.648000 --> 00:59:42.025000
He toyed with 'em first,

662
00:59:42.484000 --> 00:59:44.903000
tried to make me decide

663
00:59:45.361000 --> 00:59:47.072000
which order
they'd die in.

664
00:59:50.825000 --> 00:59:53.787000
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

665
00:59:54.245000 --> 00:59:55.413000
but it's gettin' worse.

666
00:59:55.872000 --> 00:59:57.040000
Because of Frost.

667
00:59:57.499000 --> 00:59:58.124000
There's somethin'
happenin'

668
00:59:58.583000 --> 01:00:00.543000
in the vampire ranks.

669
01:00:01.002000 --> 01:00:02.003000
It's somethin' big...

670
01:00:02.462000 --> 01:00:03.838000
and I'd stake my life

671
01:00:04.297000 --> 01:00:07.842000
that son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.

672
01:00:11.596000 --> 01:00:12.597000
Blade.

673
01:00:30.490000 --> 01:00:32.367000
Whistler told me
what happened.

674
01:00:35.245000 --> 01:00:38.832000
He told me
what you are.

675
01:00:41.668000 --> 01:00:43.420000
You don't know me.

676
01:00:43.878000 --> 01:00:45.797000
You don't know
anything about me.

677
01:00:49.134000 --> 01:00:51.177000
I'm not human.

678
01:00:53.888000 --> 01:00:55.140000
You look human
to me...

679
01:00:55.598000 --> 01:00:58.101000
Humans don't
drink blood.

680
01:00:58.560000 --> 01:01:00.687000
That was
a longtime ago.

681
01:01:01.146000 --> 01:01:04.065000
Maybe you should
let that go.

682
01:01:06.985000 --> 01:01:08.486000
I have spent
my whole life

683
01:01:08.945000 --> 01:01:12.240000
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

684
01:01:12.699000 --> 01:01:14.659000
It made me what I am.

685
01:01:17.537000 --> 01:01:21.124000
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

686
01:01:21.583000 --> 01:01:24.085000
I geta little piece
of that life back,

687
01:01:24.544000 --> 01:01:27.964000
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

688
01:01:31.134000 --> 01:01:33.053000
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

689
01:01:33.511000 --> 01:01:35.305000
Two of them against your
entire security force?

690
01:01:35.764000 --> 01:01:37.766000
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

691
01:01:38.224000 --> 01:01:39.559000
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate...

692
01:01:40.018000 --> 01:01:41.352000
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

693
01:01:41.811000 --> 01:01:42.645000
Aah! You little skeez!

694
01:01:43.104000 --> 01:01:44.397000
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

695
01:01:44.856000 --> 01:01:46.649000
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

696
01:01:47.108000 --> 01:01:48.318000
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

697
01:01:48.777000 --> 01:01:50.612000
You got
what you deserved.

698
01:01:53.656000 --> 01:01:55.992000
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

699
01:01:56.451000 --> 01:01:57.827000
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

700
01:01:58.286000 --> 01:01:59.204000
He took my hand again!

701
01:01:59.662000 --> 01:02:01.456000
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

702
01:02:01.915000 --> 01:02:03.458000
What the fuck
are you talk...

703
01:02:03.917000 --> 01:02:05.085000
you want him alive?

704
01:02:05.543000 --> 01:02:07.629000
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

705
01:02:08.088000 --> 01:02:10.173000
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

706
01:02:10.632000 --> 01:02:14.260000
Big guy, relax.

707
01:02:14.719000 --> 01:02:15.970000
Be patient.

708
01:02:17.597000 --> 01:02:19.724000
Now, we gota lot
to do here.

709
01:02:20.183000 --> 01:02:21.142000
I need you, man.

710
01:02:21.601000 --> 01:02:22.894000
Heh.

711
01:02:23.353000 --> 01:02:24.354000
Heh.

712
01:02:25.563000 --> 01:02:26.147000
I need you.

713
01:02:26.606000 --> 01:02:27.607000
Yeah.

714
01:03:11.025000 --> 01:03:12.569000
Morning.

715
01:03:13.027000 --> 01:03:14.571000
How you feelin'?

716
01:03:23.997000 --> 01:03:24.998000
Look at that.

717
01:03:29.210000 --> 01:03:31.463000
Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

718
01:03:31.921000 --> 01:03:32.505000
Heh heh.

719
01:03:34.007000 --> 01:03:35.133000
When was the last time

720
01:03:35.592000 --> 01:03:37.969000
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

721
01:03:38.428000 --> 01:03:40.346000
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

722
01:03:40.805000 --> 01:03:42.932000
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

723
01:03:43.391000 --> 01:03:43.975000
That's OK.

724
01:03:44.434000 --> 01:03:45.101000
It's all right.

725
01:03:45.560000 --> 01:03:46.686000
Least we're here together.

726
01:03:47.145000 --> 01:03:48.021000
Share the moment,

727
01:03:48.480000 --> 01:03:51.191000
which means a lot to me,
by the way, really.

728
01:03:51.649000 --> 01:03:53.026000
I mean that.

729
01:03:57.947000 --> 01:03:59.908000
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

730
01:04:00.366000 --> 01:04:02.077000
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

731
01:04:05.455000 --> 01:04:07.999000
Do what you want,
Frost.

732
01:04:08.458000 --> 01:04:10.377000
Doesn't make
any difference.

733
01:04:11.711000 --> 01:04:14.672000
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

734
01:04:15.965000 --> 01:04:17.133000
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

735
01:04:17.592000 --> 01:04:19.094000
Hold him.

736
01:04:21.679000 --> 01:04:23.765000
You will never rule us.

737
01:04:25.350000 --> 01:04:27.268000
Aah!

738
01:04:30.980000 --> 01:04:32.148000
Aah!

739
01:04:35.235000 --> 01:04:36.027000
Ow.

740
01:04:36.486000 --> 01:04:38.113000
Jesus Christ.

741
01:04:38.571000 --> 01:04:39.364000
Have a nice day.

742
01:04:39.823000 --> 01:04:40.740000
Sorry, you old dog.

743
01:04:41.199000 --> 01:04:43.868000
You just gota little
too long in the tooth.

744
01:04:45.370000 --> 01:04:47.288000
What, man?
That was funny.

745
01:04:47.747000 --> 01:04:48.998000
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

746
01:04:49.457000 --> 01:04:51.793000
Did I tell you
the one about...

747
01:04:54.129000 --> 01:04:55.714000
Aah!

748
01:05:21.531000 --> 01:05:23.491000
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

749
01:05:30.623000 --> 01:05:32.876000
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

750
01:05:33.334000 --> 01:05:36.463000
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkk tkk.

751
01:05:42.469000 --> 01:05:43.470000
Whistler.

752
01:05:46.848000 --> 01:05:48.016000
What is this?

753
01:05:49.809000 --> 01:05:52.020000
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

754
01:05:52.479000 --> 01:05:53.730000
I took it
from the archives.

755
01:05:54.189000 --> 01:05:55.231000
It's written in blood.

756
01:05:55.690000 --> 01:05:58.151000
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

757
01:06:02.572000 --> 01:06:04.991000
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

758
01:06:05.450000 --> 01:06:07.243000
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

759
01:06:07.702000 --> 01:06:09.037000
the spirits of the 12.

760
01:06:09.496000 --> 01:06:10.121000
I... I don't know.

761
01:06:10.580000 --> 01:06:11.873000
I can't make out
the rest of it.

762
01:06:12.332000 --> 01:06:13.541000
Maybe this'll help.

763
01:06:14.626000 --> 01:06:15.960000
I'll figure out something.

764
01:06:17.629000 --> 01:06:18.880000
So what's all this?

765
01:06:19.339000 --> 01:06:21.508000
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

766
01:06:21.966000 --> 01:06:23.510000
borrowed some equipment.

767
01:06:23.968000 --> 01:06:26.596000
For your
miracle cure?

768
01:06:28.515000 --> 01:06:29.432000
This is E.D.T.A.

769
01:06:29.891000 --> 01:06:30.558000
It's an anticoagulant.

770
01:06:31.017000 --> 01:06:33.061000
We use it
to treat blood clots.

771
01:06:33.520000 --> 01:06:36.481000
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

772
01:06:36.940000 --> 01:06:39.359000
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

773
01:06:40.568000 --> 01:06:42.070000
Take a step back.

774
01:06:42.529000 --> 01:06:44.114000
The reaction's
energetic.

775
01:06:53.581000 --> 01:06:54.249000
Some cure.

776
01:06:54.708000 --> 01:06:57.210000
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

777
01:06:57.669000 --> 01:06:59.212000
But maybe
you could use it

778
01:06:59.671000 --> 01:07:01.798000
to explode
some vampire heads.

779
01:07:04.300000 --> 01:07:04.884000
Wait a minute.

780
01:07:05.343000 --> 01:07:07.095000
I need a sample
of your blood.

781
01:07:07.554000 --> 01:07:08.304000
Later.

782
01:07:08.763000 --> 01:07:10.557000
Gotta go downtown.

783
01:07:11.015000 --> 01:07:11.850000
Need some serum.

784
01:07:12.308000 --> 01:07:13.226000
Serum can wait.

785
01:07:13.685000 --> 01:07:15.228000
This is important.

786
01:07:37.375000 --> 01:07:38.752000
Is he sick?

787
01:07:39.210000 --> 01:07:40.211000
Cancer.

788
01:07:42.464000 --> 01:07:45.175000
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

789
01:07:45.633000 --> 01:07:47.594000
We have
a good arrangement.

790
01:07:48.053000 --> 01:07:50.597000
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

791
01:07:54.642000 --> 01:07:56.436000
You know,
my mother used to say,

792
01:07:56.895000 --> 01:07:59.147000
"A cold heart
is a dead heart."

793
01:08:17.207000 --> 01:08:18.708000
You don't look so good.

794
01:08:19.793000 --> 01:08:21.169000
I'm just a little tired.

795
01:08:21.628000 --> 01:08:22.796000
You know we've been...

796
01:08:23.254000 --> 01:08:24.589000
workin' all night.

797
01:08:27.217000 --> 01:08:29.677000
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

798
01:08:31.304000 --> 01:08:32.389000
You got another day,

799
01:08:32.847000 --> 01:08:34.599000
two at the most.

800
01:08:39.479000 --> 01:08:41.356000
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

801
01:08:41.815000 --> 01:08:44.943000
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

802
01:09:03.044000 --> 01:09:04.045000
Blade.

803
01:09:29.487000 --> 01:09:31.156000
How you doin', chief?

804
01:09:32.574000 --> 01:09:33.158000
Easy.

805
01:09:35.201000 --> 01:09:36.786000
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

806
01:09:37.245000 --> 01:09:40.206000
to wind upon the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

807
01:09:41.624000 --> 01:09:44.669000
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

808
01:09:45.128000 --> 01:09:47.088000
Had my eye on you
for years.

809
01:09:47.547000 --> 01:09:48.673000
I know all about you...

810
01:09:49.132000 --> 01:09:51.676000
your serum, Whistler...
everything.

811
01:09:52.135000 --> 01:09:53.887000
Sun block.

812
01:09:54.345000 --> 01:09:56.014000
Hey, it's a start, right?

813
01:09:56.473000 --> 01:09:59.017000
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

814
01:09:59.476000 --> 01:10:01.144000
the daywalker.

815
01:10:01.603000 --> 01:10:03.730000
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

816
01:10:04.189000 --> 01:10:06.441000
All our strengths...

817
01:10:06.900000 --> 01:10:07.817000
none of our weaknesses.

818
01:10:08.276000 --> 01:10:10.945000
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

819
01:10:11.404000 --> 01:10:13.990000
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

820
01:10:14.449000 --> 01:10:17.786000
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

821
01:10:18.244000 --> 01:10:20.997000
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

822
01:10:21.456000 --> 01:10:22.582000
Heh. You think the humans

823
01:10:23.041000 --> 01:10:24.918000
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

824
01:10:25.377000 --> 01:10:27.212000
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

825
01:10:28.797000 --> 01:10:30.048000
And they should be.

826
01:10:30.507000 --> 01:10:31.091000
You're an animal.

827
01:10:31.549000 --> 01:10:33.593000
You're afuckin'
maniac.

828
01:10:36.513000 --> 01:10:37.680000
Look at 'em.

829
01:10:38.139000 --> 01:10:40.016000
They're cattle,

830
01:10:40.475000 --> 01:10:42.018000
pieces of meat.

831
01:10:42.477000 --> 01:10:45.063000
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

832
01:10:45.522000 --> 01:10:46.106000
Plague...

833
01:10:46.564000 --> 01:10:47.607000
war...

834
01:10:48.066000 --> 01:10:49.234000
famine.

835
01:10:49.692000 --> 01:10:51.653000
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

836
01:10:52.112000 --> 01:10:54.739000
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

837
01:10:55.198000 --> 01:10:57.200000
the new race.

838
01:10:58.785000 --> 01:11:01.371000
Looks like
your mascara's running.

839
01:11:08.545000 --> 01:11:10.422000
I'm offering you a truce.

840
01:11:10.880000 --> 01:11:12.090000
I want you with us.

841
01:11:12.549000 --> 01:11:14.509000
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

842
01:11:23.143000 --> 01:11:24.728000
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

843
01:11:25.186000 --> 01:11:27.480000
Frost...

844
01:11:27.939000 --> 01:11:30.150000
you're nothing
to me...

845
01:11:30.608000 --> 01:11:33.153000
but another
dead vampire.

846
01:11:33.611000 --> 01:11:35.155000
You're an idiot.
You know that?

847
01:11:35.613000 --> 01:11:38.324000
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

848
01:11:38.783000 --> 01:11:41.703000
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

849
01:11:42.162000 --> 01:11:43.413000
Careful.

850
01:11:47.834000 --> 01:11:50.253000
What do I care?

851
01:11:50.712000 --> 01:11:52.630000
They're nothing
but cattle...

852
01:11:53.089000 --> 01:11:54.507000
just like you said.

853
01:11:54.966000 --> 01:11:57.552000
If you wanna take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

854
01:11:58.011000 --> 01:12:00.513000
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

855
01:12:00.972000 --> 01:12:03.975000
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

856
01:12:13.443000 --> 01:12:14.778000
aah!

857
01:12:38.843000 --> 01:12:40.053000
Go home.

858
01:12:43.473000 --> 01:12:44.182000
It was simple.

859
01:12:44.641000 --> 01:12:46.601000
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

860
01:12:47.060000 --> 01:12:48.978000
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

861
01:12:49.437000 --> 01:12:50.814000
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

862
01:12:51.272000 --> 01:12:52.023000
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

863
01:12:52.482000 --> 01:12:54.609000
That means that
we have to treat it

864
01:12:55.068000 --> 01:12:55.902000
with gene therapy,

865
01:12:56.361000 --> 01:12:58.321000
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

866
01:12:58.780000 --> 01:13:01.074000
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

867
01:13:01.533000 --> 01:13:02.659000
Are you sure
that's safe?

868
01:13:03.118000 --> 01:13:04.119000
I have no idea,

869
01:13:04.577000 --> 01:13:07.038000
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

870
01:13:08.665000 --> 01:13:10.542000
You actually think
this could work?

871
01:13:11.000000 --> 01:13:12.460000
On me...

872
01:13:12.919000 --> 01:13:14.212000
yes.

873
01:13:14.671000 --> 01:13:16.840000
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

874
01:13:17.298000 --> 01:13:18.508000
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

875
01:13:18.967000 --> 01:13:20.427000
from a bite
like I did.

876
01:13:20.885000 --> 01:13:22.053000
He was born with it.

877
01:13:22.512000 --> 01:13:24.180000
It's... it's part
of his DNA.

878
01:13:24.639000 --> 01:13:27.142000
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

879
01:13:27.600000 --> 01:13:28.810000
but it’s gonna
take time.

880
01:13:29.269000 --> 01:13:31.229000
Ah, we're out of time.

881
01:13:31.688000 --> 01:13:34.023000
You saw what was
on that disc.

882
01:13:38.737000 --> 01:13:40.196000
Damn.

883
01:13:42.240000 --> 01:13:43.408000
Get out of here.

884
01:14:08.183000 --> 01:14:10.435000
I said get out of here!

885
01:14:16.107000 --> 01:14:17.192000
Nice place.

886
01:14:17.650000 --> 01:14:19.861000
Took us a while
to find it!

887
01:14:27.118000 --> 01:14:28.661000
Bite me
and get it over with.

888
01:14:29.120000 --> 01:14:30.955000
I ain't gonna bite you.

889
01:14:44.427000 --> 01:14:45.428000
Do your thing.

890
01:14:57.857000 --> 01:14:59.025000
Whistler.

891
01:15:59.502000 --> 01:16:00.503000
Ohh.

892
01:16:06.676000 --> 01:16:09.095000
Frost took her.

893
01:16:16.811000 --> 01:16:18.271000
Listen to me.

894
01:16:21.316000 --> 01:16:22.484000
The disc.

895
01:16:23.818000 --> 01:16:25.028000
He decoded it.

896
01:16:25.487000 --> 01:16:28.281000
Frost is trying to...

897
01:16:28.740000 --> 01:16:32.202000
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

898
01:16:34.329000 --> 01:16:36.331000
There's some kind of...

899
01:16:36.790000 --> 01:16:39.918000
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

900
01:16:41.544000 --> 01:16:43.088000
La Magra.

901
01:16:46.466000 --> 01:16:48.218000
You're the key.

902
01:16:49.719000 --> 01:16:51.429000
He needs
your blood.

903
01:16:55.225000 --> 01:16:57.352000
The blood
of the daywalker.

904
01:16:59.979000 --> 01:17:02.607000
You're the chosen one.

905
01:17:06.194000 --> 01:17:07.445000
Listen to me, Blade.

906
01:17:08.988000 --> 01:17:10.532000
You can't
go after him.

907
01:17:10.990000 --> 01:17:12.283000
Bullshit.

908
01:17:12.742000 --> 01:17:14.577000
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

909
01:17:15.036000 --> 01:17:17.455000
it's all over.

910
01:17:20.417000 --> 01:17:23.086000
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

911
01:17:25.839000 --> 01:17:26.840000
Shit.

912
01:17:31.177000 --> 01:17:33.179000
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

913
01:17:33.638000 --> 01:17:36.933000
Don't want me
coming back.

914
01:17:38.893000 --> 01:17:40.770000
We can treat
the wounds.

915
01:17:42.480000 --> 01:17:43.857000
It's too far gone.

916
01:17:44.315000 --> 01:17:46.443000
You know that.

917
01:17:49.779000 --> 01:17:52.449000
Give me your gun.

918
01:17:53.867000 --> 01:17:55.452000
No.

919
01:17:56.619000 --> 01:17:59.289000
Give me
the god-damn gun.

920
01:18:24.397000 --> 01:18:25.356000
Now walk away,

921
01:18:25.815000 --> 01:18:28.109000
you stupid
son of a bitch.

922
01:18:32.906000 --> 01:18:35.241000
Walk the fuck away.

923
01:18:56.262000 --> 01:18:57.180000
By the time you watch this,

924
01:18:57.639000 --> 01:18:58.890000
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

925
01:18:59.349000 --> 01:19:00.809000
If it makes any
difference to you,

926
01:19:01.267000 --> 01:19:02.519000
he put up
quite a fight.

927
01:19:02.977000 --> 01:19:05.647000
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

928
01:20:43.953000 --> 01:20:44.913000
You seem a bit...

929
01:20:45.372000 --> 01:20:46.039000
tense.

930
01:20:46.498000 --> 01:20:48.083000
A bit pent-up maybe,

931
01:20:48.541000 --> 01:20:50.043000
like you need to
release something.

932
01:20:51.127000 --> 01:20:51.795000
You know?

933
01:20:52.253000 --> 01:20:53.338000
Blade not...

934
01:20:54.631000 --> 01:20:56.883000
givin' it to you
maybe.

935
01:20:57.967000 --> 01:20:59.010000
I don't know.
I just...

936
01:21:00.470000 --> 01:21:02.472000
I see such
a beautiful woman.

937
01:21:04.182000 --> 01:21:05.433000
Great skin.

938
01:21:08.228000 --> 01:21:09.938000
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

939
01:21:10.397000 --> 01:21:13.566000
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

940
01:21:15.110000 --> 01:21:17.237000
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

941
01:21:17.695000 --> 01:21:18.905000
Go ahead.

942
01:21:19.364000 --> 01:21:20.532000
Bite me.

943
01:21:20.990000 --> 01:21:23.576000
I'll just cure myself.

944
01:21:24.035000 --> 01:21:24.994000
I did it before,

945
01:21:25.453000 --> 01:21:26.746000
and I can do it again.

946
01:21:27.205000 --> 01:21:28.581000
There is no cure,
baby.

947
01:21:29.040000 --> 01:21:30.166000
There is if you've
been bit,

948
01:21:30.625000 --> 01:21:33.920000
if you were once human.

949
01:21:39.300000 --> 01:21:40.343000
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

950
01:21:40.802000 --> 01:21:41.928000
A born vampire

951
01:21:42.387000 --> 01:21:44.723000
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

952
01:21:45.181000 --> 01:21:47.976000
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

953
01:21:48.435000 --> 01:21:49.394000
Isn't that right?

954
01:21:49.853000 --> 01:21:52.856000
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

955
01:21:53.314000 --> 01:21:56.025000
You're just... infected,
a virus...

956
01:21:56.484000 --> 01:21:58.111000
a sexually transmitted
disease.

957
01:21:58.570000 --> 01:21:59.612000
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

958
01:22:00.071000 --> 01:22:02.240000
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

959
01:22:02.699000 --> 01:22:04.367000
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

960
01:22:04.826000 --> 01:22:06.369000
you people
are fuckin' history.

961
01:22:07.954000 --> 01:22:09.080000
He's a hurricane,

962
01:22:09.539000 --> 01:22:11.166000
an act of God.

963
01:22:11.624000 --> 01:22:12.959000
Anyone caught
in his path

964
01:22:13.418000 --> 01:22:14.586000
will instantly
be turned.

965
01:22:16.504000 --> 01:22:17.797000
Everyone you've
ever known,

966
01:22:18.256000 --> 01:22:21.009000
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

967
01:22:21.468000 --> 01:22:23.053000
It won't matter
who's pureblood

968
01:22:23.511000 --> 01:22:24.721000
and who's not.

969
01:22:25.180000 --> 01:22:27.807000
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

970
01:22:29.559000 --> 01:22:31.102000
Hmm?

971
01:22:34.564000 --> 01:22:36.524000
And Blade's blood
is the key.

972
01:22:37.067000 --> 01:22:38.735000
We got an intruder.

973
01:23:07.806000 --> 01:23:08.681000
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

974
01:23:09.140000 --> 01:23:10.016000
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

975
01:23:10.475000 --> 01:23:12.143000
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...

976
01:23:12.602000 --> 01:23:14.020000
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

977
01:23:14.479000 --> 01:23:15.647000
Yeah, the swords.

978
01:23:16.106000 --> 01:23:17.023000
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

979
01:23:17.482000 --> 01:23:18.733000
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

980
01:23:19.192000 --> 01:23:20.151000
There's no
intruder where we are.

981
01:23:20.610000 --> 01:23:22.028000
Look, make it happen,
all right?

982
01:23:22.487000 --> 01:23:23.696000
It's one guy on foot.

983
01:23:28.451000 --> 01:23:30.078000
That's him!
Get him!

984
01:23:49.556000 --> 01:23:51.099000
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

985
01:23:51.558000 --> 01:23:53.893000
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

986
01:23:54.352000 --> 01:23:55.353000
I need him alive.

987
01:23:55.812000 --> 01:23:56.896000
No!

988
01:23:59.524000 --> 01:24:01.484000
Please!

989
01:24:01.943000 --> 01:24:03.153000
I just work for them!

990
01:24:05.488000 --> 01:24:06.948000
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

991
01:24:07.407000 --> 01:24:08.408000
Yes, sir!

992
01:24:45.153000 --> 01:24:47.322000
Aah!

993
01:24:47.781000 --> 01:24:49.949000
Aieee!
Aah!

994
01:25:55.765000 --> 01:25:57.434000
Eric?

995
01:26:08.486000 --> 01:26:10.155000
But you died.

996
01:26:11.489000 --> 01:26:13.533000
I came back, Eric.

997
01:26:13.992000 --> 01:26:15.285000
That very same night...

998
01:26:17.078000 --> 01:26:19.664000
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

999
01:26:27.589000 --> 01:26:29.507000
Uhh!

1000
01:26:36.681000 --> 01:26:39.142000
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1001
01:26:39.601000 --> 01:26:40.602000
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1002
01:26:41.061000 --> 01:26:42.395000
and you act like this?

1003
01:26:44.105000 --> 01:26:46.024000
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1004
01:26:46.483000 --> 01:26:48.193000
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1005
01:26:48.651000 --> 01:26:49.652000
Uh! Uhh!

1006
01:26:51.613000 --> 01:26:52.739000
Don't look so surprised.

1007
01:26:53.198000 --> 01:26:54.657000
You spent your whole life

1008
01:26:55.116000 --> 01:26:57.494000
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1009
01:26:57.952000 --> 01:26:59.871000
Well, here I am.

1010
01:27:02.165000 --> 01:27:03.083000
Who would ever guess

1011
01:27:03.541000 --> 01:27:05.627000
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1012
01:27:06.086000 --> 01:27:07.003000
But you did.

1013
01:27:07.462000 --> 01:27:08.671000
And here we are...

1014
01:27:09.130000 --> 01:27:11.466000
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1015
01:27:22.852000 --> 01:27:24.604000
I need my serum.

1016
01:27:27.315000 --> 01:27:28.274000
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1017
01:27:28.733000 --> 01:27:30.527000
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1018
01:27:30.985000 --> 01:27:32.529000
There's one catch.

1019
01:27:36.491000 --> 01:27:38.076000
If it works,

1020
01:27:38.535000 --> 01:27:39.452000
you'll lose
your strength

1021
01:27:39.911000 --> 01:27:43.873000
and your ability
to regenerate.

1022
01:27:44.332000 --> 01:27:46.334000
You'll be
completely human.

1023
01:28:07.522000 --> 01:28:08.565000
Uhh!

1024
01:28:48.229000 --> 01:28:50.607000
Blade, Karen,

1025
01:28:51.066000 --> 01:28:52.567000
glad you could make it.

1026
01:28:53.026000 --> 01:28:55.320000
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1027
01:28:56.696000 --> 01:28:58.740000
Our ancestors
called this place

1028
01:28:59.199000 --> 01:29:01.409000
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1029
01:29:04.537000 --> 01:29:06.039000
Nice, isn't it?

1030
01:29:06.498000 --> 01:29:09.000000
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1031
01:29:09.459000 --> 01:29:11.795000
Fortunately for us...

1032
01:29:12.253000 --> 01:29:13.254000
I'm what you
might call a...

1033
01:29:13.713000 --> 01:29:16.299000
student of history.

1034
01:29:29.604000 --> 01:29:31.689000
Why are we here?

1035
01:29:33.149000 --> 01:29:37.320000
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

1036
01:29:37.779000 --> 01:29:41.074000
this night,
for the Blood God.

1037
01:29:49.416000 --> 01:29:50.625000
Thanks.

1038
01:29:55.880000 --> 01:29:57.424000
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1039
01:30:00.969000 --> 01:30:02.095000
Well.

1040
01:30:02.554000 --> 01:30:03.263000
Titanium, right?

1041
01:30:03.722000 --> 01:30:05.724000
Acid-etched?

1042
01:30:07.517000 --> 01:30:10.270000
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1043
01:30:15.859000 --> 01:30:16.568000
What?

1044
01:30:17.026000 --> 01:30:19.487000
You look surprised.

1045
01:30:19.946000 --> 01:30:21.156000
I told you, Blade,

1046
01:30:21.614000 --> 01:30:23.742000
I know everything
about you.

1047
01:30:24.826000 --> 01:30:25.869000
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1048
01:30:26.327000 --> 01:30:27.078000
Why, man?

1049
01:30:27.537000 --> 01:30:28.204000
These are... they're,
like, all better.

1050
01:30:28.663000 --> 01:30:29.581000
Hold out your arm.

1051
01:30:30.040000 --> 01:30:31.041000
Now.

1052
01:30:35.003000 --> 01:30:36.046000
Deac, l...

1053
01:30:41.259000 --> 01:30:42.260000
Just kidding.

1054
01:30:44.554000 --> 01:30:46.181000
Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.

1055
01:30:46.639000 --> 01:30:47.932000
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1056
01:30:48.391000 --> 01:30:48.975000
Blade.

1057
01:30:49.434000 --> 01:30:51.394000
Blade.

1058
01:30:51.853000 --> 01:30:52.520000
He can't hear you,
honey.

1059
01:30:52.979000 --> 01:30:54.522000
The thirst has
got him now.

1060
01:31:01.321000 --> 01:31:02.113000
What do we have here?

1061
01:31:02.572000 --> 01:31:04.949000
The precious serum.

1062
01:31:05.408000 --> 01:31:08.787000
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1063
01:31:09.245000 --> 01:31:11.623000
12, 13 hours maybe?

1064
01:31:12.082000 --> 01:31:14.000000
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1065
01:31:14.459000 --> 01:31:15.585000
aren’t you?

1066
01:31:18.088000 --> 01:31:19.297000
What's it feel like?

1067
01:31:21.257000 --> 01:31:22.801000
Is your blood on fire?

1068
01:31:23.259000 --> 01:31:25.303000
Try some.

1069
01:31:25.762000 --> 01:31:28.014000
You might like it.

1070
01:31:28.473000 --> 01:31:30.517000
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1071
01:31:30.975000 --> 01:31:32.894000
In any event,

1072
01:31:33.353000 --> 01:31:35.438000
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1073
01:31:42.821000 --> 01:31:44.197000
It's a shame, you know?

1074
01:31:45.490000 --> 01:31:46.825000
When I think of what
you've become,

1075
01:31:47.283000 --> 01:31:49.536000
what you should
have become.

1076
01:31:49.994000 --> 01:31:51.579000
I guess
I don't blame you.

1077
01:31:52.038000 --> 01:31:53.373000
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1078
01:31:53.832000 --> 01:31:54.874000
it's the human
side of you

1079
01:31:55.333000 --> 01:31:56.626000
that's made you weak.

1080
01:31:57.085000 --> 01:31:58.253000
You should've listened
to your blood.

1081
01:31:58.712000 --> 01:32:00.630000
Say what you want,

1082
01:32:01.089000 --> 01:32:03.883000
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1083
01:32:04.342000 --> 01:32:05.510000
Ooh.

1084
01:32:08.179000 --> 01:32:10.140000
Get him outta here.

1085
01:32:14.519000 --> 01:32:16.521000
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1086
01:32:16.980000 --> 01:32:18.398000
Come on. Let's go.

1087
01:32:18.857000 --> 01:32:20.608000
Let's go.

1088
01:32:24.571000 --> 01:32:25.488000
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1089
01:32:25.947000 --> 01:32:26.698000
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1090
01:32:27.157000 --> 01:32:28.074000
Oh, no, baby.

1091
01:32:28.533000 --> 01:32:31.494000
We got something real
special planned for you.

1092
01:32:32.746000 --> 01:32:34.039000
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1093
01:32:34.497000 --> 01:32:35.415000
I sucked him dry.

1094
01:32:35.874000 --> 01:32:37.250000
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1095
01:32:37.709000 --> 01:32:38.626000
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1096
01:32:39.085000 --> 01:32:40.045000
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1097
01:32:40.503000 --> 01:32:42.005000
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1098
01:32:43.923000 --> 01:32:44.591000
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1099
01:32:45.050000 --> 01:32:46.009000
Pathetic.

1100
01:32:46.468000 --> 01:32:48.136000
Yeah. These guys
are complete scum, man.

1101
01:32:48.595000 --> 01:32:49.512000
They'll eat anything...

1102
01:32:49.971000 --> 01:32:53.641000
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1103
01:32:55.060000 --> 01:32:56.019000
They'll even
eat vampires.

1104
01:32:56.478000 --> 01:32:57.645000
That's a plus.

1105
01:32:58.104000 --> 01:32:59.147000
And bearing that
all in mind,

1106
01:32:59.606000 --> 01:33:01.441000
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1107
01:33:03.234000 --> 01:33:04.444000
Uh!

1108
01:33:06.112000 --> 01:33:07.113000
Uh!

1109
01:33:07.572000 --> 01:33:08.239000
It's too bad.

1110
01:33:08.698000 --> 01:33:11.076000
I kinda liked her.

1111
01:33:11.534000 --> 01:33:12.702000
What a waste.

1112
01:33:34.432000 --> 01:33:36.267000
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1113
01:33:37.560000 --> 01:33:39.020000
No pulse.

1114
01:33:39.479000 --> 01:33:40.313000
And, of course,

1115
01:33:40.772000 --> 01:33:42.565000
there's the question
of lividity.

1116
01:33:44.359000 --> 01:33:45.568000
Curtis?

1117
01:33:47.654000 --> 01:33:48.988000
Ahh.

1118
01:33:49.447000 --> 01:33:51.449000
Karen?

1119
01:33:52.617000 --> 01:33:53.660000
Karen.

1120
01:33:54.953000 --> 01:33:57.122000
I never thought
I would see you again.

1121
01:33:57.580000 --> 01:33:59.082000
Tell me, Karen,

1122
01:33:59.541000 --> 01:34:01.584000
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1123
01:34:19.811000 --> 01:34:21.146000
Karen!

1124
01:34:21.604000 --> 01:34:23.565000
Karen!

1125
01:34:24.023000 --> 01:34:25.275000
Karen!

1126
01:34:26.609000 --> 01:34:28.611000
Karen!

1127
01:34:29.070000 --> 01:34:30.321000
Karen.

1128
01:34:30.780000 --> 01:34:32.866000
Karen!

1129
01:35:37.764000 --> 01:35:39.349000
Poor child.

1130
01:35:41.142000 --> 01:35:42.685000
You're so sick.

1131
01:35:44.104000 --> 01:35:45.855000
So thirsty.

1132
01:35:46.314000 --> 01:35:48.483000
Don't touch me.

1133
01:35:51.069000 --> 01:35:53.571000
Eric, look at me.

1134
01:35:54.030000 --> 01:35:56.366000
Vampires are
my people now.

1135
01:35:56.825000 --> 01:35:59.119000
I'm one of them.

1136
01:35:59.577000 --> 01:36:00.912000
Can't be.

1137
01:36:02.455000 --> 01:36:04.165000
Yes, it can.

1138
01:36:06.584000 --> 01:36:09.045000
Try to understand,
Eric.

1139
01:36:10.213000 --> 01:36:13.425000
Your mother died
a longtime ago.

1140
01:36:15.844000 --> 01:36:17.262000
I've hunted...

1141
01:36:18.930000 --> 01:36:20.390000
I've killed...

1142
01:36:22.767000 --> 01:36:24.561000
and I've enjoyed it.

1143
01:36:26.271000 --> 01:36:27.439000
Haven't you?

1144
01:36:29.190000 --> 01:36:30.608000
I know you have.

1145
01:36:32.902000 --> 01:36:34.070000
Sooner or later,

1146
01:36:34.529000 --> 01:36:36.573000
the thirst
always wins.

1147
01:37:21.117000 --> 01:37:22.285000
Come on.

1148
01:37:29.084000 --> 01:37:30.251000
Spread them out.

1149
01:37:31.461000 --> 01:37:33.963000
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1150
01:37:34.422000 --> 01:37:36.174000
Make it perfect.

1151
01:38:14.254000 --> 01:38:15.547000
Yeah.

1152
01:38:16.756000 --> 01:38:18.425000
Bring the elevator up.

1153
01:38:57.881000 --> 01:38:59.883000
You stupid girl.

1154
01:39:00.341000 --> 01:39:01.051000
What do you think
is Going to happen?

1155
01:39:01.509000 --> 01:39:02.093000
La Magra?

1156
01:39:02.552000 --> 01:39:03.595000
The Blood God?

1157
01:39:04.054000 --> 01:39:05.263000
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1158
01:39:05.722000 --> 01:39:07.390000
for pretty
little vampires.

1159
01:39:07.849000 --> 01:39:08.683000
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1160
01:39:09.142000 --> 01:39:12.562000
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1161
01:39:13.021000 --> 01:39:15.148000
your pureblood spirit.

1162
01:39:15.607000 --> 01:39:17.192000
You should be.

1163
01:39:17.650000 --> 01:39:18.902000
Read the prophecy.

1164
01:39:19.361000 --> 01:39:20.320000
It's time you fucks

1165
01:39:20.779000 --> 01:39:22.489000
contributed something
to the cause.

1166
01:39:26.493000 --> 01:39:27.702000
Even if Frost is right,

1167
01:39:28.161000 --> 01:39:30.830000
you really think
he cares about you?

1168
01:39:31.289000 --> 01:39:32.082000
You're gonna die,

1169
01:39:32.540000 --> 01:39:33.792000
just like
the rest of us.

1170
01:39:34.250000 --> 01:39:35.251000
Waah!

1171
01:39:59.317000 --> 01:40:00.443000
Blade.

1172
01:40:09.703000 --> 01:40:13.039000
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1173
01:40:13.498000 --> 01:40:14.708000
No more compromises.

1174
01:40:15.166000 --> 01:40:17.419000
We're gonna be gods.

1175
01:40:19.087000 --> 01:40:19.879000
Of course we are.

1176
01:40:20.338000 --> 01:40:23.174000
Yeah!

1177
01:40:23.633000 --> 01:40:24.634000
I'm gonna be naughty.

1178
01:40:25.093000 --> 01:40:26.970000
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1179
01:40:27.429000 --> 01:40:28.430000
Ha ha ha!

1180
01:40:35.562000 --> 01:40:37.021000
Gotta stop...

1181
01:40:38.648000 --> 01:40:39.691000
stop...

1182
01:40:40.150000 --> 01:40:41.860000
Save your strength.

1183
01:40:42.318000 --> 01:40:43.319000
Blue.

1184
01:40:44.654000 --> 01:40:46.072000
You're hypovolemic.

1185
01:40:46.531000 --> 01:40:47.824000
You're bleeding
to death.

1186
01:40:48.283000 --> 01:40:49.868000
Need...

1187
01:40:50.326000 --> 01:40:51.161000
serum.

1188
01:41:09.429000 --> 01:41:10.430000
Blade.

1189
01:41:12.265000 --> 01:41:14.225000
Blade.

1190
01:41:16.478000 --> 01:41:17.562000
Listen to me.

1191
01:41:19.230000 --> 01:41:21.566000
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1192
01:41:23.443000 --> 01:41:24.819000
No.

1193
01:41:27.155000 --> 01:41:28.323000
No.

1194
01:41:29.491000 --> 01:41:31.826000
Look, just do it.

1195
01:41:57.519000 --> 01:41:58.603000
Is everybody thirsty?

1196
01:41:59.062000 --> 01:42:02.524000
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1197
01:42:21.084000 --> 01:42:23.211000
Ohh...

1198
01:42:23.670000 --> 01:42:24.754000
don’t stop.

1199
01:42:27.924000 --> 01:42:29.008000
Don’t stop.

1200
01:42:34.556000 --> 01:42:35.557000
Don’t stop.

1201
01:42:50.155000 --> 01:42:51.573000
Don’t stop.

1202
01:43:04.461000 --> 01:43:06.504000
Aah!

1203
01:43:43.708000 --> 01:43:45.335000
How was it?

1204
01:43:46.628000 --> 01:43:47.754000
Aah!

1205
01:43:53.510000 --> 01:43:55.929000
Aah!

1206
01:43:56.388000 --> 01:43:57.931000
Aah!

1207
01:43:58.390000 --> 01:44:01.142000
Aah!

1208
01:44:06.940000 --> 01:44:08.817000
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1209
01:44:11.486000 --> 01:44:13.613000
Uhh!

1210
01:44:21.079000 --> 01:44:22.497000
Aah!

1211
01:44:44.686000 --> 01:44:46.312000
Aah!

1212
01:44:50.567000 --> 01:44:51.735000
Aah!

1213
01:44:56.364000 --> 01:44:57.741000
Eric...

1214
01:44:58.825000 --> 01:45:00.410000
I'm your mother.

1215
01:45:02.662000 --> 01:45:05.081000
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1216
01:45:05.540000 --> 01:45:06.541000
would you?

1217
01:45:09.335000 --> 01:45:10.336000
Come here.

1218
01:45:14.799000 --> 01:45:16.968000
I must release you.

1219
01:45:27.979000 --> 01:45:28.980000
Fuck!

1220
01:45:30.523000 --> 01:45:32.609000
Aah!

1221
01:45:47.624000 --> 01:45:48.625000
Aah!

1222
01:45:55.423000 --> 01:45:56.424000
Aah!

1223
01:46:26.246000 --> 01:46:27.038000
Uhh!

1224
01:46:27.497000 --> 01:46:28.915000
Unh!

1225
01:46:29.374000 --> 01:46:30.375000
Unh!

1226
01:46:34.003000 --> 01:46:34.963000
Deacon?

1227
01:46:35.422000 --> 01:46:36.589000
Not anymore.

1228
01:46:52.522000 --> 01:46:54.190000
Frost!

1229
01:46:54.649000 --> 01:46:55.316000
Kill him.

1230
01:46:55.775000 --> 01:46:57.402000
Wait! I owe you, man.

1231
01:46:57.861000 --> 01:46:59.320000
I got two new hands, Blade.

1232
01:46:59.779000 --> 01:47:02.115000
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1233
01:47:02.574000 --> 01:47:04.034000
Aah!

1234
01:47:16.588000 --> 01:47:18.757000
Yaah!

1235
01:47:22.552000 --> 01:47:24.387000
Frost.

1236
01:47:26.431000 --> 01:47:27.807000
Yaah!

1237
01:47:41.404000 --> 01:47:43.365000
I got struck
by lightning

1238
01:47:44.908000 --> 01:47:46.076000
Aah!

1239
01:47:46.534000 --> 01:47:47.994000
Aah!

1240
01:48:10.350000 --> 01:48:11.684000
Aah!

1241
01:48:46.219000 --> 01:48:48.430000
I'm really Going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1242
01:49:13.371000 --> 01:49:14.914000
Yaah!

1243
01:49:21.129000 --> 01:49:22.964000
Aah!

1244
01:49:36.978000 --> 01:49:38.563000
Hey, Blade.

1245
01:49:40.523000 --> 01:49:42.484000
Let's do this.

1246
01:50:25.568000 --> 01:50:27.028000
Aah!

1247
01:50:27.487000 --> 01:50:29.447000
Aah! Aah!

1248
01:50:36.121000 --> 01:50:37.872000
You're too late, Blade.

1249
01:50:57.434000 --> 01:50:58.560000
My turn.

1250
01:51:25.170000 --> 01:51:25.962000
Look at you.

1251
01:51:26.421000 --> 01:51:27.672000
You're a little bitch.

1252
01:51:29.549000 --> 01:51:31.051000
What, your serum?

1253
01:51:31.509000 --> 01:51:33.011000
It can't help you
now, stud.

1254
01:51:40.435000 --> 01:51:41.478000
Nice shot.

1255
01:52:02.540000 --> 01:52:04.918000
Aah!

1256
01:52:07.212000 --> 01:52:08.922000
Aah!

1257
01:52:09.381000 --> 01:52:10.924000
Aah! Aah!

1258
01:52:13.718000 --> 01:52:14.469000
Some motherfuckers

1259
01:52:14.928000 --> 01:52:17.847000
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1260
01:52:24.020000 --> 01:52:25.021000
Uhh!

1261
01:52:34.572000 --> 01:52:39.577000
Aah!

1262
01:52:49.796000 --> 01:52:51.339000
Blade!

1263
01:52:59.514000 --> 01:53:01.433000
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:53:37.469000 --> 01:53:39.012000
I need to get back
to the lab

1265
01:53:39.471000 --> 01:53:42.057000
if I'm going to cure you.

1266
01:53:42.515000 --> 01:53:44.059000
It's not over.

1267
01:53:44.517000 --> 01:53:45.977000
You keep your cure.

1268
01:53:47.103000 --> 01:53:48.563000
There's still
a war going on,

1269
01:53:49.022000 --> 01:53:51.024000
and I have a job to do.

1270
01:53:51.483000 --> 01:53:53.234000
You want to help,

1271
01:53:53.693000 --> 01:53:56.029000
make me a better serum.

1272
01:54:50.375000 --> 01:54:51.292000
Uhh!
