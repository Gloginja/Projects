1
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,424
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:06,967
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:08,927
Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,013
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,474
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,783
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,535
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,578
I'll bet this.

9
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:17,621
Aah!

10
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,248
Ha ha ha!

11
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,749
So, where are we going?

12
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,501
It's a surprise,
baby.

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,253
Yeah, I like surprises.

14
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,214
Yeah.

15
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,428
Whoo!
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,514
What the fuck
are we doing here?

17
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,518
Whoo! Look at all that.

18
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:42,271
Ha ha ha!

19
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,648
What the fuck is that?

20
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:51,071
Hey!

21
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,618
What did you just say?

22
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,533
Wow.

23
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,841
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

24
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,385
Unh! Aan!

25
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,270
Whoo!

26
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,189
All right.

27
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,400
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,364
Yeah.

29
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,241
Whoo!

30
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,463
Ha ha ha!

31
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,757
What's happening?

32
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:35,217
Unh!

33
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:41,640
Whoa!

34
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,767
Aan.

35
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,190
Fuck.

36
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,370
Fuck. I need a drink.

37
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,730
Ahh!

38
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,461
No! No!

39
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,132
Aah!

40
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,968
What's wrong, baby?

41
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,930
Aah! Aah!

42
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,182
No! No!

43
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,519
Aah! No!

44
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,605
Ha ha ha!

45
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,317
Is that him?

46
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:59,194
Jesus, that's him.

47
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,448
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

48
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,679
Come on, daywalker!

49
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,649
Aah!

50
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:48,327
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

51
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:49,787
Unh!

52
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,637
Aah!

53
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:34,957
Aah!

54
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,426
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

55
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:46,718
Fuck him up!

56
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,888
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

57
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,558
Whoo!

58
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,020
Yaah!

59
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:41,815
Yaah!

60
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,290
Quinn...

61
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:01,877
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

62
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:09,885
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

63
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,807
Give my regards to Frost.

64
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,395
No! Please don't!

65
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:36,120
Put him out.

66
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:38,580
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

67
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,481
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

68
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,567
1, 2, 3.

69
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:13,949
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

70
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,452
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

71
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,289
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

72
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,624
That's very pretty.

73
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,722
Did you check
the chem count?

74
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,766
His sugar's
3times norm,

75
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:40,601
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

76
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:44,188
You took this
off a D.O. A?

77
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,482
Yeah.

78
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,692
But this doesn't
make any sense.

79
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,197
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

80
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:54,782
which is impossible.

81
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,494
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

82
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:04,541
OK, Curtis, it's3.00
in the morning...

83
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,001
This is not a joke.

84
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,588
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

85
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,591
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

86
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,719
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

87
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,521
OK. Show me the body.

88
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,190
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

89
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,193
Done. We've had
that conversation.

90
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:36,990
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

91
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,160
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

92
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:45,040
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

93
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,835
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

94
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:49,253
I'm going
to start the "Y"

95
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,130
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

96
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,096
Let me ask you
something.

97
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,140
Honestly...

98
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:02,933
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

99
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,021
Sometimes.

100
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:11,984
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

101
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,527
Want to cut me
some slack here?

102
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:16,405
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

103
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:17,448
Look, Curtis...

104
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,032
I'm trying.

105
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:20,492
It's over.

106
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,504
Yaah!

107
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,595
Aah!

108
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,014
Call security!

109
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,321
Aah!

110
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,114
Came back
to finish you off.

111
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,617
Get out of my way,
you freak!

112
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,167
Freeze!

113
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:15,047
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

114
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:16,507
Aah!
Aah!

115
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,053
Yaah!

116
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,017
Aah!

117
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:08,684
Hey, you! Freeze!

118
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,154
Aah!

119
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:21,196
Aah!

120
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,490
Aah!

121
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:27,828
Freeze!

122
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,164
Hold it right there!

123
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,758
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:46,597
My shoulder.

125
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,266
It's dislocated.

126
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:53,729
Aah!

127
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:01,570
Uhh!

128
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,668
Whistler.

129
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,840
Whistler.

130
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,639
Bringing home
strays now?

131
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:56,393
She's been bitten.

132
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,066
Should've
killed her, then.

133
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,109
Yeah, I know.

134
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:08,155
But I didn't.

135
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,914
You watch her close.

136
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:20,167
If she starts to turn,
You finish her off.

137
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:25,714
Or I will.

138
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,676
Uhh.

139
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,681
She's border line.

140
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:40,145
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

141
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,023
Dr Karen Jenson,

142
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:45,192
Listen close.

143
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,569
I'm Going to inject you
with allium sativum...

144
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,488
garlic.

145
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:51,824
This is going
to hurt... a lot.

146
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:54,076
It was Quinn.

147
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:56,495
Frost's little
errand boy?

148
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:58,580
You get
a lead on him?

149
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,706
No.

150
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,751
Too bad.

151
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,003
Uhh!

152
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:06,505
Hold her.

153
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:19,435
I give her fifty-fifty

154
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:23,439
if she makes it
through the night.

155
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,048
Blade...

156
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,134
the daywalker...

157
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:55,679
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

158
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,559
How many died?

159
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:03,062
We don't have
an exact count.

160
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,355
Apparently, he used
a lot of sliver.

161
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,024
We're having
difficulty...

162
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,859
Send in Frost.

163
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:18,786
Deacon Frost.

164
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,250
You can come in now.

165
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,285
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

166
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,246
Are they?

167
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:05,124
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

168
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,375
You know our policy.

169
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,585
Your policy,
not mine.

170
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:10,712
Our livelihood...

171
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:16,051
depends on our ability
to blend in

172
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,470
and our discretion.

173
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,266
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

174
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:24,143
We should be ruling
the humans,

175
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:25,310
not running around

176
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,146
making back-alley treaties
with them.

177
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:29,648
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

178
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:30,691
not our allies.

179
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,151
You're out of line, Frost.

180
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:33,986
Am I?

181
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:35,904
Or maybe I'm just
The first to say out loud

182
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,448
what we've
all been thinking.

183
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:39,324
We have existed this way

184
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:42,119
for thousands of years.

185
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:43,162
Who are you

186
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,999
to challenge our ways?

187
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,626
You're not even
a pureblood.

188
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,339
Like it matters.

189
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:59,094
I was born a vampire,

190
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:02,723
as was every other member
of this house,

191
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,433
but you, Frost...

192
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:10,481
you were merely turned.

193
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,234
The world belongs to us,

194
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,653
not the humans.

195
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:18,447
You know that.

196
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,537
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

197
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,123
Well, uh...

198
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,084
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

199
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,335
We're having
difficulty...

200
00:22:31,794 --> 00:22:32,586
And have you made
the transfer to the...

201
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,046
Gitano...

202
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:38,425
you may wake upone day
and find yourself extinct.

203
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,626
You're a week early.

204
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,503
Yeah.

205
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,471
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

206
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:30,310
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

207
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,947
You take care, all right?

208
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,178
I must be getting
soft in my old age,

209
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:31,598
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

210
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,226
It was damn stupid of you.

211
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:36,645
Might've lucked out,
though.

212
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,399
I checked her background.

213
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:46,071
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

214
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:50,159
She might be useful to us.

215
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:51,994
I doubt it.

216
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,080
I'm serious.

217
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:56,999
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

218
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,585
She's onto something.

219
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,756
I had to increase
the dose.

220
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:07,092
It's over
50 milligrams now.

221
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:08,510
That's getting
dangerous.

222
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,053
Just do it,

223
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:12,264
old man.

224
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:15,184
Ahh.

225
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,612
Uhh...

226
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:14,827
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

227
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,080
Who are you people?

228
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,665
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

229
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,751
You've met Blade.

230
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:40,394
So, am I
a prisoner here?

231
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,022
Not at all.

232
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,649
We just had to take
certain precautions

233
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,110
before we let you go.

234
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,237
You got to understand,

235
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:51,655
they're everywhere.

236
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:53,907
Vampires...

237
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,784
the Hominus nocturna.

238
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:58,412
We hunt them, you see...

239
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:00,497
moving from one city
to the next

240
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:02,166
tracking
their migrations.

241
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:03,751
They're hard to kill.

242
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:05,627
They tend to regenerate.

243
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,171
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

244
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:10,674
Well, you already met
Mr Crispy at the hospital.

245
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,468
What do you think?

246
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,054
So, what do you use, then?

247
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:18,182
Stakes? Crosses?

248
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,142
Crosses don't do squat.

249
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:23,228
Some of the legends
are true, though.

250
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:26,523
Vampires are severely
allergic to sliver.

251
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:28,525
Feed them garlic,

252
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:30,069
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

253
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,071
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

254
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:33,989
ultraviolet rays.

255
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:37,117
I got this sucker
running.

256
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:39,661
You want to give it
a try tonight?

257
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,752
It's still heavy.

258
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,546
Well, you're so big.

259
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,258
If you want to live
to see another day,

260
00:28:53,717 --> 00:28:55,177
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

261
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:57,638
So where am I
supposed to go?

262
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:03,602
You've been exposed to them.

263
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:07,398
One way or another, somebody's
Going to take you out.

264
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:14,780
There's a war going on
out there.

265
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,699
Blade, myself,
a few others,

266
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,076
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

267
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:20,160
onto the streets.

268
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:22,746
Sometimes,
people like yourself

269
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,624
get caught
in the crossfire.

270
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,127
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

271
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:31,046
They own the police.

272
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:32,923
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

273
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,259
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

274
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:36,343
and didn't know it...

275
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,595
on the subway
or in a bar.

276
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:43,142
So that's it?

277
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,603
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

278
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:52,067
Here.

279
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:53,861
Vampire mace...

280
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,114
sliver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

281
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:59,783
You keep your eyes open.

282
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:02,119
Be careful.

283
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,666
One other thing...

284
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,170
buy yourself a gun.

285
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:15,215
If you start getting
sensitive to day light...

286
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:17,426
if you find
you're thirsty

287
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,679
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

288
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,222
then I suggest
you take that gun

289
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:25,267
and use it on yourself.

290
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:30,481
Better that
than the alternative.

291
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:30,165
You have been warned
before.

292
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:31,667
These archives
are restricted

293
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:35,129
to members
of the House of Erebus.

294
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,924
You are wasting your time.

295
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:41,009
It's a dead language.

296
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:45,222
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

297
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,517
You wouldn't even
Understand them.

298
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:51,562
Damn it, Frost!

299
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,105
I'm talking to you!

300
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,775
Shh.

301
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,653
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

302
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,906
We're in a library.

303
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,366
You don’t need
to shout.

304
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:08,746
What are you up to,
Frost?

305
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:22,468
What are you
Going to do, hmm?

306
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:28,015
What?

307
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,105
You bore me.

308
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:05,385
Hey!

309
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:12,643
Remember
what we told you.

310
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:14,937
You keep your eyes open.

311
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:16,021
They're everywhere.

312
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,817
But it's daytime!

313
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,919
How you doing?

314
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,166
Hit here. Hey.

315
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,251
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

316
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,128
Whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, Hold on.

317
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:45,170
Police officer.

318
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:46,463
I'm sorry, OK?

319
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:48,048
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

320
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:49,133
The front door was open.

321
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:50,259
What are you doing in here?

322
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,554
I'm just here
on a routine check.

323
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:55,180
Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,

324
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,640
42nd precinct.

325
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,643
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

326
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:01,437
Yeah.

327
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,147
Your co-workers
at the hospital

328
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:06,734
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

329
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,235
Are you OK?

330
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:11,780
What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

331
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,324
Curtis Webb?

332
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:16,285
Um, he died.

333
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:18,328
No, look,

334
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:19,913
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

335
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:21,957
Why?

336
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:25,627
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

337
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,296
Aah!

338
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,048
Bitch!
What is it?

339
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:34,511
What is this, garlic?

340
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,181
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

341
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,099
Vampires?

342
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,478
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

343
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:45,814
Nobody.

344
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:52,946
He's a familiar...

345
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:55,074
a vampire wannabe.

346
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,243
If he's loyal enough

347
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:03,207
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

348
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:05,667
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

349
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,920
Get over it.

350
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:13,592
Is all that necessary?

351
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:20,432
That's a glyph...

352
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:22,059
a vampire cattle brand.

353
00:37:22,518 --> 00:37:25,020
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

354
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,147
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

355
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:30,025
then they have to answer
to his owner.

356
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:33,737
Deacon Frost.

357
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,198
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

358
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,033
All right.

359
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,743
Officer Krieger,

360
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:42,621
you Going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

361
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,540
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

362
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:45,707
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

363
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,209
You going
to rob me, too?

364
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,337
How do you think that we
Fund this organization, huh?

365
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:54,299
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

366
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,678
It's fake.

367
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:01,557
Well...

368
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:04,685
looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

369
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:06,311
Hillbarn Clinic.

370
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,813
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

371
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:09,106
Owned by vampires,

372
00:38:09,565 --> 00:38:10,566
and there's one
in every city.

373
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:12,151
And they always deliver.

374
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:13,944
So, where were you
taking it?

375
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:15,821
I don't know what
you're talking... aah!

376
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,864
Ooh!

377
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:19,199
Look, take it easy.

378
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:21,368
I'm only Going to ask you
one more time.

379
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,079
Where were you taking it?

380
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:25,789
Go fuck yourself.

381
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:27,708
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

382
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:46,935
You better wake up.

383
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:50,189
The world you live in is
Just a sugar-coated topping.

384
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,733
There is another world
beneath it...

385
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:53,942
the real world.

386
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,194
And if you want
to survive it,

387
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:58,572
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

388
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,285
Wait a minute.

389
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:04,328
I'm coming with you.

390
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:05,788
You're useless.

391
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,752
I have to stick with you.

392
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,088
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

393
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:16,215
to find a cure for myself.

394
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:18,592
There is no cure.

395
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,895
He's not going
to come back.

396
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:32,648
Nobody's that’s stupid.

397
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:35,943
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

398
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:38,112
you know what
it's capable of.

399
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,755
It's Krieger.

400
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:58,090
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

401
00:39:58,549 --> 00:39:59,383
Yes?

402
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:00,926
Get me through.

403
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,765
I got a delivery
in progress here,

404
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:08,517
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

405
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:17,568
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

406
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,549
Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

407
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,509
That's a vampire mark.

408
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:43,761
It means that
there's a safe house

409
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:45,345
around here somewhere...

410
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:48,348
a place they can go
with donors coming.

411
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:50,642
See the valets
over there?

412
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:52,269
They're vampires.

413
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:54,813
So is the doorman

414
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:57,775
and the whore
on the corner.

415
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,568
How can you tell?

416
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,779
By the way they move...

417
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:03,238
the way they smell.

418
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:04,698
Psst.

419
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:09,369
It's like a bad dream.

420
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:11,830
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

421
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,123
Like what?

422
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:14,958
Like me.

423
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:18,420
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

424
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,172
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

425
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:22,174
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

426
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,510
You use a stake, sliver,
or sun light.

427
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:26,553
You know how to use
one of these?

428
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:27,721
Nope...

429
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,556
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

430
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:31,183
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...

431
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:32,476
sliver hollow point
filled with garlic.

432
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,144
You aim for the head
or the heart.

433
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:36,146
Anything else is your ass.

434
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:40,109
Do you have
an invitation?

435
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,182
What you got?

436
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:30,743
Kenji!

437
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:45,758
Ohh!

438
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:47,259
Where's the entrance?

439
00:42:47,718 --> 00:42:48,427
I can't tell you
that, man.

440
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:50,345
Uhh!

441
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:54,224
I'm Going to ask you
one more time.

442
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:56,143
Where's the entrance?

443
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:58,437
OK. OK.

444
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:01,523
It's in the freezer.

445
00:43:10,783 --> 00:43:12,034
Come on, man!
I told you!

446
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:14,495
It's in the fridge!

447
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:23,712
OK.

448
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,964
You give Frost
a message from me.

449
00:43:26,423 --> 00:43:28,634
You tell him it's
open season on suck heads.

450
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:14,054
Some kind of archive.

451
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,102
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

452
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,312
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

453
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:24,815
They've got their claws
into everything...

454
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:26,859
politics, finance,
real estate.

455
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:30,320
They already own
half of downtown.

456
00:44:53,635 --> 00:44:55,220
Frost throws a good party.

457
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,805
Yeah...

458
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:58,891
but where is he?

459
00:45:12,988 --> 00:45:14,198
Come on, baby.

460
00:45:23,707 --> 00:45:26,335
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

461
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:46,563
Deacon,

462
00:45:47,022 --> 00:45:49,733
there's someone here
to see you.

463
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:54,988
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

464
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:57,199
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

465
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:59,243
It's a mistake
Going to Pearl's.

466
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,829
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

467
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,122
I know you're
disappointed.

468
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,164
Am I that
transparent?

469
00:46:04,623 --> 00:46:05,207
You want
to meet him?

470
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:06,250
Yeah.

471
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,543
I can get you guys
in with him,

472
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,253
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

473
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:10,754
Fuck.

474
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,005
Aw, fuck. Frost.

475
00:46:12,464 --> 00:46:13,465
Hey.
Yeah.

476
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,009
Deac. Deac.

477
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:18,262
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

478
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:19,513
They've been dying
to meet you.

479
00:46:19,972 --> 00:46:20,597
They are so psyched.

480
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:22,141
Bad ass bitches.
They...

481
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,517
Hi.

482
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:24,560
Deac?

483
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:27,229
Frost, it's about Blade.

484
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:28,647
Aw, he's busy, you know?

485
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:30,482
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

486
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:33,402
Look, Frost,
this is important.

487
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,446
Blade was waiting for me,

488
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:37,906
using the girl as bait.

489
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:39,783
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

490
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:40,993
Shut up, bitch.

491
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:42,494
I didn't know he was
Going to be there.

492
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:43,954
It was a trap, see?

493
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:45,289
But don't worry
About it.

494
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:47,374
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

495
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,169
Yeah!

496
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,177
Whoo!

497
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:20,157
Forget the girl.

498
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:21,575
I want Blade.

499
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,452
I know you do.

500
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:24,495
You hear me, Quinn?

501
00:47:24,953 --> 00:47:26,872
I want him alive.

502
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,332
What?

503
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:32,044
Wait a minute, man.

504
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:34,296
You want him alive?

505
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:38,842
What's that smell?

506
00:47:41,804 --> 00:47:43,639
...image carefully, Frost.

507
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:49,103
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

508
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,105
Krieger, is that you?

509
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:52,356
He... he's here!

510
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:53,399
He's here!

511
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:55,150
This must be Pearl,

512
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:56,193
the record keeper.

513
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,239
He's Going to kill me!

514
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:02,741
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

515
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,451
Pearl, you're history.

516
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,995
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

517
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:08,789
Frost.

518
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:10,791
Ruthless bloodsucker.

519
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,042
Congratulations, Blade.

520
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:13,585
Frost.

521
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:15,212
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

522
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:16,255
I'm flattered.

523
00:48:16,714 --> 00:48:18,132
It'll pass.

524
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:21,218
Fuck.

525
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:24,805
What is that?

526
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,349
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. lamp.

527
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:28,434
We're gonna play

528
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:30,227
a little game
of 20 questions.

529
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,979
Depending on
how you answer,

530
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:34,940
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

531
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:36,275
What's that?

532
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:38,110
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

533
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:40,112
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

534
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:42,406
Actually,
it's a video game.

535
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,877
That must've hurt.

536
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,920
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

537
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:58,213
What prophecy?

538
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:00,132
Oh, I'm not really sure.

539
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:02,301
There are so many out...

540
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,985
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

541
00:49:20,444 --> 00:49:21,904
Is that so?

542
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:25,032
Well, that's
what Frost says.

543
00:49:25,491 --> 00:49:26,742
Then you won't mind me

544
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:29,620
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

545
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,622
If he moves, fry him.

546
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:35,542
What's in here?

547
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:36,794
Nothing.
It's a... a storeroom.

548
00:49:37,252 --> 00:49:38,337
But you’re
wasting your time.

549
00:49:38,796 --> 00:49:40,422
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

550
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:42,424
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

551
00:49:42,883 --> 00:49:43,967
No!

552
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:07,950
He moved.

553
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:40,983
What is this?

554
00:50:42,568 --> 00:50:43,485
These are the pages

555
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,863
from The Book
of Erebus,

556
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:47,698
the Vampire Bible.

557
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,703
It contains everything...

558
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:54,580
their entire history.

559
00:50:55,831 --> 00:50:59,376
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

560
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:04,214
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

561
00:51:04,673 --> 00:51:05,883
Shh!

562
00:51:43,128 --> 00:51:44,630
Give me your hand.

563
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:50,427
Do you remember me?

564
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:10,197
Give it to him!

565
00:52:26,046 --> 00:52:26,964
Hey! Hey!

566
00:52:27,423 --> 00:52:29,133
Nice one.

567
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:30,175
Heh.

568
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:31,343
Well, well, well.

569
00:52:31,802 --> 00:52:33,595
You took my arm, man.

570
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,556
Remember?

571
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,391
But it's cool.

572
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,893
I gota new one.

573
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,272
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

574
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:46,942
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

575
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:49,027
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

576
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:50,195
Check it out.

577
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:52,448
I've got his pig sticker.

578
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:54,241
Ah ha ha ha...

579
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,409
Ohh! Aah!

580
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:58,287
You're a fuckup, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

581
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:00,664
You're a fuckup!

582
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:02,291
"I got his pig sticker!"

583
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,500
Ohh.

584
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:06,003
You're just
full of surprises,

585
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:07,755
ain'tyou, chief?

586
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:18,015
Stay with me, sweetness...

587
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:21,393
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

588
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:25,439
Ah, looky here.

589
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:28,984
Sliver.

590
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:30,652
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

591
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,780
Probably costyou
a pretty penny.

592
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:37,367
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

593
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:41,747
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

594
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:48,253
Come to think of it, Blade,

595
00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:50,422
I owe you one.

596
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:57,471
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

597
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,516
I owe you two.

598
00:54:03,602 --> 00:54:05,687
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

599
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,776
I'm expecting company.

600
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:28,210
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

601
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:29,878
No! No guns!

602
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,507
No! No! No!

603
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:41,598
No! Fuckin' this way!

604
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:51,859
Drop the guns!

605
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:53,235
I need him!

606
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:55,904
He wants Blade alive! Go!

607
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:01,869
You've been
listening in the whole time?

608
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:03,287
Keeping
radio contact.

609
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:06,582
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

610
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:17,176
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

611
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:19,803
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

612
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,396
Whistler!

613
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:31,482
He can take care
of himself.

614
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,941
Jump!

615
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:56,048
Aah!

616
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:10,270
Aah!

617
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:35,713
Aah!

618
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,887
Aah!

619
00:56:53,939 --> 00:56:55,691
What are you
gonna do?

620
00:56:56,775 --> 00:56:58,152
Oh, my God.

621
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,293
What's wrong?

622
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:18,589
It's dislocated.

623
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:20,340
Ah!

624
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,301
Let me help you.

625
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:26,889
Aah!

626
00:57:33,937 --> 00:57:34,855
Let me give you...

627
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:37,066
No! Getaway.

628
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:54,833
You're one of them,
aren't you?

629
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:59,004
No.

630
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:00,756
I'm something else.

631
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:10,974
I found him
when he was 13.

632
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:12,976
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

633
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:14,978
feedin' off
the homeless.

634
00:58:15,437 --> 00:58:17,940
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

635
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:21,985
I took him
for a vampire at first.

636
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:23,821
Almost killed him, too.

637
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,907
Then I realized
what he was.

638
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:30,077
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

639
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:31,954
while she was pregnant.

640
00:58:32,413 --> 00:58:34,915
She died, but he lived.

641
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:36,125
Unfortunately,

642
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,711
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

643
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:42,673
He can withstand
garlic, sliver,

644
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:44,258
even sunlight,

645
00:58:44,717 --> 00:58:46,301
and he's got
their strength.

646
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:48,178
This time tomorrow,

647
00:58:48,637 --> 00:58:51,390
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

648
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,436
He still ages
like a human, though.

649
00:58:55,894 --> 00:58:58,021
See, vampires
age slower than us.

650
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,608
Unfortunately...

651
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:03,986
he also inherited
their thirst.

652
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:08,157
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

653
00:59:08,615 --> 00:59:10,868
Time's runnin' out.

654
00:59:12,411 --> 00:59:15,330
His body's
startin' to reject it.

655
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:19,877
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have falled.

656
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,300
Why do you hunt them?

657
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,596
I had a family once...

658
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:33,307
wife and two daughters.

659
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:38,062
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

660
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,521
a vampire.

661
00:59:41,648 --> 00:59:43,025
He toyed with 'em first,

662
00:59:43,484 --> 00:59:45,903
tried to make me decide

663
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:48,072
which order
they'd die in.

664
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:54,787
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

665
00:59:55,245 --> 00:59:56,413
but it's gettin' worse.

666
00:59:56,872 --> 00:59:58,040
Because of Frost.

667
00:59:58,499 --> 00:59:59,124
There's somethin'
happenin'

668
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,543
in the vampire ranks.

669
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:03,003
It's somethin' big...

670
01:00:03,462 --> 01:00:04,838
and I'd stake my life

671
01:00:05,297 --> 01:00:08,842
that son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.

672
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:13,597
Blade.

673
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,367
Whistler told me
what happened.

674
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:39,832
He told me
what you are.

675
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:44,420
You don't know me.

676
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:46,797
You don't know
anything about me.

677
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,177
I'm not human.

678
01:00:54,888 --> 01:00:56,140
You look human
to me...

679
01:00:56,598 --> 01:00:59,101
Humans don't
drink blood.

680
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,687
That was
a longtime ago.

681
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:05,065
Maybe you should
let that go.

682
01:01:07,985 --> 01:01:09,486
I have spent
my whole life

683
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:13,240
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

684
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:15,659
It made me what I am.

685
01:01:18,537 --> 01:01:22,124
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

686
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,085
I geta little piece
of that life back,

687
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:28,964
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

688
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:34,053
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

689
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:36,305
Two of them against your
entire security force?

690
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:38,766
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

691
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:40,559
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate...

692
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:42,352
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

693
01:01:42,811 --> 01:01:43,645
Aah! You little skeez!

694
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,397
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

695
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:47,649
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

696
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:49,318
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

697
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,612
You got
what you deserved.

698
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:56,992
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

699
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:58,827
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

700
01:01:59,286 --> 01:02:00,204
He took my hand again!

701
01:02:00,662 --> 01:02:02,456
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

702
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:04,458
What the fuck
are you talk...

703
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,085
you want him alive?

704
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:08,629
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

705
01:02:09,088 --> 01:02:11,173
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

706
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:15,260
Big guy, relax.

707
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:16,970
Be patient.

708
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,724
Now, we gota lot
to do here.

709
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,142
I need you, man.

710
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:23,894
Heh.

711
01:02:24,353 --> 01:02:25,354
Heh.

712
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:27,147
I need you.

713
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:28,607
Yeah.

714
01:03:12,025 --> 01:03:13,569
Morning.

715
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,571
How you feelin'?

716
01:03:24,997 --> 01:03:25,998
Look at that.

717
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,463
Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

718
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:33,505
Heh heh.

719
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:36,133
When was the last time

720
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:38,969
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

721
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:41,346
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

722
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:43,932
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

723
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:44,975
That's OK.

724
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:46,101
It's all right.

725
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,686
Least we're here together.

726
01:03:48,145 --> 01:03:49,021
Share the moment,

727
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,191
which means a lot to me,
by the way, really.

728
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:54,026
I mean that.

729
01:03:58,947 --> 01:04:00,908
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

730
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:03,077
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

731
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:08,999
Do what you want,
Frost.

732
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,377
Doesn't make
any difference.

733
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:15,672
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

734
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:18,133
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

735
01:04:18,592 --> 01:04:20,094
Hold him.

736
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,765
You will never rule us.

737
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,268
Aah!

738
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,148
Aah!

739
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:37,027
Ow.

740
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:39,113
Jesus Christ.

741
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:40,364
Have a nice day.

742
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:41,740
Sorry, you old dog.

743
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,868
You just gota little
too long in the tooth.

744
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,288
What, man?
That was funny.

745
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:49,998
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

746
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:52,793
Did I tell you
the one about...

747
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,714
Aah!

748
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:24,491
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

749
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,876
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

750
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:37,463
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkk tkk.

751
01:05:43,469 --> 01:05:44,470
Whistler.

752
01:05:47,848 --> 01:05:49,016
What is this?

753
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:53,020
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

754
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:54,730
I took it
from the archives.

755
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,231
It's written in blood.

756
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:59,151
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

757
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:05,991
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

758
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,243
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

759
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:10,037
the spirits of the 12.

760
01:06:10,496 --> 01:06:11,121
I... I don't know.

761
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,873
I can't make out
the rest of it.

762
01:06:13,332 --> 01:06:14,541
Maybe this'll help.

763
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:16,960
I'll figure out something.

764
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:19,880
So what's all this?

765
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:22,508
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

766
01:06:22,966 --> 01:06:24,510
borrowed some equipment.

767
01:06:24,968 --> 01:06:27,596
For your
miracle cure?

768
01:06:29,515 --> 01:06:30,432
This is E.D.T.A.

769
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:31,558
It's an anticoagulant.

770
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:34,061
We use it
to treat blood clots.

771
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,481
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

772
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,359
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

773
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:43,070
Take a step back.

774
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:45,114
The reaction's
energetic.

775
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:55,249
Some cure.

776
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:58,210
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

777
01:06:58,669 --> 01:07:00,212
But maybe
you could use it

778
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:02,798
to explode
some vampire heads.

779
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:05,884
Wait a minute.

780
01:07:06,343 --> 01:07:08,095
I need a sample
of your blood.

781
01:07:08,554 --> 01:07:09,304
Later.

782
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:11,557
Gotta go downtown.

783
01:07:12,015 --> 01:07:12,850
Need some serum.

784
01:07:13,308 --> 01:07:14,226
Serum can wait.

785
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,228
This is important.

786
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,752
Is he sick?

787
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,211
Cancer.

788
01:07:43,464 --> 01:07:46,175
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

789
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:48,594
We have
a good arrangement.

790
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:51,597
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

791
01:07:55,642 --> 01:07:57,436
You know,
my mother used to say,

792
01:07:57,895 --> 01:08:00,147
"A cold heart
is a dead heart."

793
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:19,708
You don't look so good.

794
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,169
I'm just a little tired.

795
01:08:22,628 --> 01:08:23,796
You know we've been...

796
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:25,589
workin' all night.

797
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:30,677
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

798
01:08:32,304 --> 01:08:33,389
You got another day,

799
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:35,599
two at the most.

800
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,356
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

801
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:45,943
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

802
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:05,045
Blade.

803
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,156
How you doin', chief?

804
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:34,158
Easy.

805
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:37,786
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

806
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:41,206
to wind upon the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

807
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,669
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

808
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:48,088
Had my eye on you
for years.

809
01:09:48,547 --> 01:09:49,673
I know all about you...

810
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:52,676
your serum, Whistler...
everything.

811
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:54,887
Sun block.

812
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:57,014
Hey, it's a start, right?

813
01:09:57,473 --> 01:10:00,017
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

814
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:02,144
the daywalker.

815
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:04,730
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

816
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:07,441
All our strengths...

817
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,817
none of our weaknesses.

818
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,945
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

819
01:10:12,404 --> 01:10:14,990
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

820
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:18,786
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

821
01:10:19,244 --> 01:10:21,997
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

822
01:10:22,456 --> 01:10:23,582
Heh. You think the humans

823
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,918
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

824
01:10:26,377 --> 01:10:28,212
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

825
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:31,048
And they should be.

826
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:32,091
You're an animal.

827
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:34,593
You're afuckin'
maniac.

828
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:38,680
Look at 'em.

829
01:10:39,139 --> 01:10:41,016
They're cattle,

830
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:43,018
pieces of meat.

831
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:46,063
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

832
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:47,106
Plague...

833
01:10:47,564 --> 01:10:48,607
war...

834
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:50,234
famine.

835
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:52,653
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

836
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:55,739
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

837
01:10:56,198 --> 01:10:58,200
the new race.

838
01:10:59,785 --> 01:11:02,371
Looks like
your mascara's running.

839
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:11,422
I'm offering you a truce.

840
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,090
I want you with us.

841
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:15,509
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

842
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:25,728
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

843
01:11:26,186 --> 01:11:28,480
Frost...

844
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:31,150
you're nothing
to me...

845
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,153
but another
dead vampire.

846
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:36,155
You're an idiot.
You know that?

847
01:11:36,613 --> 01:11:39,324
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

848
01:11:39,783 --> 01:11:42,703
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

849
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:44,413
Careful.

850
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:51,253
What do I care?

851
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:53,630
They're nothing
but cattle...

852
01:11:54,089 --> 01:11:55,507
just like you said.

853
01:11:55,966 --> 01:11:58,552
If you wanna take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

854
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:01,513
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

855
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:04,975
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

856
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:15,778
aah!

857
01:12:39,843 --> 01:12:41,053
Go home.

858
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:45,182
It was simple.

859
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,601
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

860
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,978
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

861
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:51,814
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

862
01:12:52,272 --> 01:12:53,023
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

863
01:12:53,482 --> 01:12:55,609
That means that
we have to treat it

864
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:56,902
with gene therapy,

865
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:59,321
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

866
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,074
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

867
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:03,659
Are you sure
that's safe?

868
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,119
I have no idea,

869
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:08,038
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

870
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:11,542
You actually think
this could work?

871
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,460
On me...

872
01:13:13,919 --> 01:13:15,212
yes.

873
01:13:15,671 --> 01:13:17,840
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

874
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:19,508
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

875
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:21,427
from a bite
like I did.

876
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:23,053
He was born with it.

877
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:25,180
It's... it's part
of his DNA.

878
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:28,142
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

879
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,810
but it’s gonna
take time.

880
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:32,229
Ah, we're out of time.

881
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:35,023
You saw what was
on that disc.

882
01:13:39,737 --> 01:13:41,196
Damn.

883
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,408
Get out of here.

884
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:11,435
I said get out of here!

885
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:18,192
Nice place.

886
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,861
Took us a while
to find it!

887
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:29,661
Bite me
and get it over with.

888
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,955
I ain't gonna bite you.

889
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:46,428
Do your thing.

890
01:14:58,857 --> 01:15:00,025
Whistler.

891
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:01,503
Ohh.

892
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:10,095
Frost took her.

893
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:19,271
Listen to me.

894
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:23,484
The disc.

895
01:16:24,818 --> 01:16:26,028
He decoded it.

896
01:16:26,487 --> 01:16:29,281
Frost is trying to...

897
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:33,202
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

898
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,331
There's some kind of...

899
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:40,918
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

900
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:44,088
La Magra.

901
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:49,218
You're the key.

902
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,429
He needs
your blood.

903
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,352
The blood
of the daywalker.

904
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:03,607
You're the chosen one.

905
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:08,445
Listen to me, Blade.

906
01:17:09,988 --> 01:17:11,532
You can't
go after him.

907
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,283
Bullshit.

908
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:15,577
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

909
01:17:16,036 --> 01:17:18,455
it's all over.

910
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:24,086
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

911
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:27,840
Shit.

912
01:17:32,177 --> 01:17:34,179
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

913
01:17:34,638 --> 01:17:37,933
Don't want me
coming back.

914
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:41,770
We can treat
the wounds.

915
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,857
It's too far gone.

916
01:17:45,315 --> 01:17:47,443
You know that.

917
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:53,449
Give me your gun.

918
01:17:54,867 --> 01:17:56,452
No.

919
01:17:57,619 --> 01:18:00,289
Give me
the god-damn gun.

920
01:18:25,397 --> 01:18:26,356
Now walk away,

921
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,109
you stupid
son of a bitch.

922
01:18:33,906 --> 01:18:36,241
Walk the fuck away.

923
01:18:57,262 --> 01:18:58,180
By the time you watch this,

924
01:18:58,639 --> 01:18:59,890
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

925
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:01,809
If it makes any
difference to you,

926
01:19:02,267 --> 01:19:03,519
he put up
quite a fight.

927
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:06,647
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

928
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:45,913
You seem a bit...

929
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:47,039
tense.

930
01:20:47,498 --> 01:20:49,083
A bit pent-up maybe,

931
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:51,043
like you need to
release something.

932
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:52,795
You know?

933
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:54,338
Blade not...

934
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:57,883
givin' it to you
maybe.

935
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:00,010
I don't know.
I just...

936
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,472
I see such
a beautiful woman.

937
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:06,433
Great skin.

938
01:21:09,228 --> 01:21:10,938
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

939
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:14,566
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

940
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,237
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

941
01:21:18,695 --> 01:21:19,905
Go ahead.

942
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:21,532
Bite me.

943
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,576
I'll just cure myself.

944
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:25,994
I did it before,

945
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,746
and I can do it again.

946
01:21:28,205 --> 01:21:29,581
There is no cure,
baby.

947
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,166
There is if you've
been bit,

948
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:34,920
if you were once human.

949
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,343
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

950
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:42,928
A born vampire

951
01:21:43,387 --> 01:21:45,723
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

952
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:48,976
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

953
01:21:49,435 --> 01:21:50,394
Isn't that right?

954
01:21:50,853 --> 01:21:53,856
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

955
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:57,025
You're just... infected,
a virus...

956
01:21:57,484 --> 01:21:59,111
a sexually transmitted
disease.

957
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:00,612
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

958
01:22:01,071 --> 01:22:03,240
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

959
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:05,367
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

960
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:07,369
you people
are fuckin' history.

961
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,080
He's a hurricane,

962
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,166
an act of God.

963
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:13,959
Anyone caught
in his path

964
01:22:14,418 --> 01:22:15,586
will instantly
be turned.

965
01:22:17,504 --> 01:22:18,797
Everyone you've
ever known,

966
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:22,009
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

967
01:22:22,468 --> 01:22:24,053
It won't matter
who's pureblood

968
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:25,721
and who's not.

969
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,807
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

970
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:32,102
Hmm?

971
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:37,524
And Blade's blood
is the key.

972
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:39,735
We got an intruder.

973
01:23:08,806 --> 01:23:09,681
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

974
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,016
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

975
01:23:11,475 --> 01:23:13,143
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...

976
01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:15,020
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

977
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:16,647
Yeah, the swords.

978
01:23:17,106 --> 01:23:18,023
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

979
01:23:18,482 --> 01:23:19,733
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

980
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,151
There's no
intruder where we are.

981
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,028
Look, make it happen,
all right?

982
01:23:23,487 --> 01:23:24,696
It's one guy on foot.

983
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:31,078
That's him!
Get him!

984
01:23:50,556 --> 01:23:52,099
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

985
01:23:52,558 --> 01:23:54,893
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

986
01:23:55,352 --> 01:23:56,353
I need him alive.

987
01:23:56,812 --> 01:23:57,896
No!

988
01:24:00,524 --> 01:24:02,484
Please!

989
01:24:02,943 --> 01:24:04,153
I just work for them!

990
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:07,948
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

991
01:24:08,407 --> 01:24:09,408
Yes, sir!

992
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:48,322
Aah!

993
01:24:48,781 --> 01:24:50,949
Aieee!
Aah!

994
01:25:56,765 --> 01:25:58,434
Eric?

995
01:26:09,486 --> 01:26:11,155
But you died.

996
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:14,533
I came back, Eric.

997
01:26:14,992 --> 01:26:16,285
That very same night...

998
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:20,664
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

999
01:26:28,589 --> 01:26:30,507
Uhh!

1000
01:26:37,681 --> 01:26:40,142
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1001
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:41,602
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1002
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:43,395
and you act like this?

1003
01:26:45,105 --> 01:26:47,024
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1004
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:49,193
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1005
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,652
Uh! Uhh!

1006
01:26:52,613 --> 01:26:53,739
Don't look so surprised.

1007
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:55,657
You spent your whole life

1008
01:26:56,116 --> 01:26:58,494
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1009
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:00,871
Well, here I am.

1010
01:27:03,165 --> 01:27:04,083
Who would ever guess

1011
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:06,627
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1012
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:08,003
But you did.

1013
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:09,671
And here we are...

1014
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:12,466
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1015
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:25,604
I need my serum.

1016
01:27:28,315 --> 01:27:29,274
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1017
01:27:29,733 --> 01:27:31,527
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1018
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:33,529
There's one catch.

1019
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,076
If it works,

1020
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:40,452
you'll lose
your strength

1021
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:44,873
and your ability
to regenerate.

1022
01:27:45,332 --> 01:27:47,334
You'll be
completely human.

1023
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:09,565
Uhh!

1024
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:51,607
Blade, Karen,

1025
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:53,567
glad you could make it.

1026
01:28:54,026 --> 01:28:56,320
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1027
01:28:57,696 --> 01:28:59,740
Our ancestors
called this place

1028
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:02,409
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1029
01:29:05,537 --> 01:29:07,039
Nice, isn't it?

1030
01:29:07,498 --> 01:29:10,000
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1031
01:29:10,459 --> 01:29:12,795
Fortunately for us...

1032
01:29:13,253 --> 01:29:14,254
I'm what you
might call a...

1033
01:29:14,713 --> 01:29:17,299
student of history.

1034
01:29:30,604 --> 01:29:32,689
Why are we here?

1035
01:29:34,149 --> 01:29:38,320
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

1036
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:42,074
this night,
for the Blood God.

1037
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:51,625
Thanks.

1038
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,424
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1039
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:03,095
Well.

1040
01:30:03,554 --> 01:30:04,263
Titanium, right?

1041
01:30:04,722 --> 01:30:06,724
Acid-etched?

1042
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:11,270
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1043
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:17,568
What?

1044
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:20,487
You look surprised.

1045
01:30:20,946 --> 01:30:22,156
I told you, Blade,

1046
01:30:22,614 --> 01:30:24,742
I know everything
about you.

1047
01:30:25,826 --> 01:30:26,869
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1048
01:30:27,327 --> 01:30:28,078
Why, man?

1049
01:30:28,537 --> 01:30:29,204
These are... they're,
like, all better.

1050
01:30:29,663 --> 01:30:30,581
Hold out your arm.

1051
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,041
Now.

1052
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,046
Deac, l...

1053
01:30:42,259 --> 01:30:43,260
Just kidding.

1054
01:30:45,554 --> 01:30:47,181
Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.

1055
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:48,932
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1056
01:30:49,391 --> 01:30:49,975
Blade.

1057
01:30:50,434 --> 01:30:52,394
Blade.

1058
01:30:52,853 --> 01:30:53,520
He can't hear you,
honey.

1059
01:30:53,979 --> 01:30:55,522
The thirst has
got him now.

1060
01:31:02,321 --> 01:31:03,113
What do we have here?

1061
01:31:03,572 --> 01:31:05,949
The precious serum.

1062
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:09,787
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1063
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:12,623
12, 13 hours maybe?

1064
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:15,000
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1065
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:16,585
aren’t you?

1066
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:20,297
What's it feel like?

1067
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:23,801
Is your blood on fire?

1068
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:26,303
Try some.

1069
01:31:26,762 --> 01:31:29,014
You might like it.

1070
01:31:29,473 --> 01:31:31,517
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1071
01:31:31,975 --> 01:31:33,894
In any event,

1072
01:31:34,353 --> 01:31:36,438
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1073
01:31:43,821 --> 01:31:45,197
It's a shame, you know?

1074
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:47,825
When I think of what
you've become,

1075
01:31:48,283 --> 01:31:50,536
what you should
have become.

1076
01:31:50,994 --> 01:31:52,579
I guess
I don't blame you.

1077
01:31:53,038 --> 01:31:54,373
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1078
01:31:54,832 --> 01:31:55,874
it's the human
side of you

1079
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:57,626
that's made you weak.

1080
01:31:58,085 --> 01:31:59,253
You should've listened
to your blood.

1081
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:01,630
Say what you want,

1082
01:32:02,089 --> 01:32:04,883
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1083
01:32:05,342 --> 01:32:06,510
Ooh.

1084
01:32:09,179 --> 01:32:11,140
Get him outta here.

1085
01:32:15,519 --> 01:32:17,521
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1086
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,398
Come on. Let's go.

1087
01:32:19,857 --> 01:32:21,608
Let's go.

1088
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:26,488
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1089
01:32:26,947 --> 01:32:27,698
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1090
01:32:28,157 --> 01:32:29,074
Oh, no, baby.

1091
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:32,494
We got something real
special planned for you.

1092
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:35,039
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1093
01:32:35,497 --> 01:32:36,415
I sucked him dry.

1094
01:32:36,874 --> 01:32:38,250
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1095
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:39,626
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1096
01:32:40,085 --> 01:32:41,045
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1097
01:32:41,503 --> 01:32:43,005
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1098
01:32:44,923 --> 01:32:45,591
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1099
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:47,009
Pathetic.

1100
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:49,136
Yeah. These guys
are complete scum, man.

1101
01:32:49,595 --> 01:32:50,512
They'll eat anything...

1102
01:32:50,971 --> 01:32:54,641
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1103
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:57,019
They'll even
eat vampires.

1104
01:32:57,478 --> 01:32:58,645
That's a plus.

1105
01:32:59,104 --> 01:33:00,147
And bearing that
all in mind,

1106
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:02,441
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1107
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:05,444
Uh!

1108
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:08,113
Uh!

1109
01:33:08,572 --> 01:33:09,239
It's too bad.

1110
01:33:09,698 --> 01:33:12,076
I kinda liked her.

1111
01:33:12,534 --> 01:33:13,702
What a waste.

1112
01:33:35,432 --> 01:33:37,267
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1113
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,020
No pulse.

1114
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:41,313
And, of course,

1115
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:43,565
there's the question
of lividity.

1116
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:46,568
Curtis?

1117
01:33:48,654 --> 01:33:49,988
Ahh.

1118
01:33:50,447 --> 01:33:52,449
Karen?

1119
01:33:53,617 --> 01:33:54,660
Karen.

1120
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:58,122
I never thought
I would see you again.

1121
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,082
Tell me, Karen,

1122
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:02,584
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1123
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:22,146
Karen!

1124
01:34:22,604 --> 01:34:24,565
Karen!

1125
01:34:25,023 --> 01:34:26,275
Karen!

1126
01:34:27,609 --> 01:34:29,611
Karen!

1127
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,321
Karen.

1128
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,866
Karen!

1129
01:35:38,764 --> 01:35:40,349
Poor child.

1130
01:35:42,142 --> 01:35:43,685
You're so sick.

1131
01:35:45,104 --> 01:35:46,855
So thirsty.

1132
01:35:47,314 --> 01:35:49,483
Don't touch me.

1133
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:54,571
Eric, look at me.

1134
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:57,366
Vampires are
my people now.

1135
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,119
I'm one of them.

1136
01:36:00,577 --> 01:36:01,912
Can't be.

1137
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:05,165
Yes, it can.

1138
01:36:07,584 --> 01:36:10,045
Try to understand,
Eric.

1139
01:36:11,213 --> 01:36:14,425
Your mother died
a longtime ago.

1140
01:36:16,844 --> 01:36:18,262
I've hunted...

1141
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:21,390
I've killed...

1142
01:36:23,767 --> 01:36:25,561
and I've enjoyed it.

1143
01:36:27,271 --> 01:36:28,439
Haven't you?

1144
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,608
I know you have.

1145
01:36:33,902 --> 01:36:35,070
Sooner or later,

1146
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:37,573
the thirst
always wins.

1147
01:37:22,117 --> 01:37:23,285
Come on.

1148
01:37:30,084 --> 01:37:31,251
Spread them out.

1149
01:37:32,461 --> 01:37:34,963
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1150
01:37:35,422 --> 01:37:37,174
Make it perfect.

1151
01:38:15,254 --> 01:38:16,547
Yeah.

1152
01:38:17,756 --> 01:38:19,425
Bring the elevator up.

1153
01:38:58,881 --> 01:39:00,883
You stupid girl.

1154
01:39:01,341 --> 01:39:02,051
What do you think
is Going to happen?

1155
01:39:02,509 --> 01:39:03,093
La Magra?

1156
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,595
The Blood God?

1157
01:39:05,054 --> 01:39:06,263
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1158
01:39:06,722 --> 01:39:08,390
for pretty
little vampires.

1159
01:39:08,849 --> 01:39:09,683
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1160
01:39:10,142 --> 01:39:13,562
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1161
01:39:14,021 --> 01:39:16,148
your pureblood spirit.

1162
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:18,192
You should be.

1163
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:19,902
Read the prophecy.

1164
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:21,320
It's time you fucks

1165
01:39:21,779 --> 01:39:23,489
contributed something
to the cause.

1166
01:39:27,493 --> 01:39:28,702
Even if Frost is right,

1167
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:31,830
you really think
he cares about you?

1168
01:39:32,289 --> 01:39:33,082
You're gonna die,

1169
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:34,792
just like
the rest of us.

1170
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,251
Waah!

1171
01:40:00,317 --> 01:40:01,443
Blade.

1172
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:14,039
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1173
01:40:14,498 --> 01:40:15,708
No more compromises.

1174
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,419
We're gonna be gods.

1175
01:40:20,087 --> 01:40:20,879
Of course we are.

1176
01:40:21,338 --> 01:40:24,174
Yeah!

1177
01:40:24,633 --> 01:40:25,634
I'm gonna be naughty.

1178
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:27,970
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1179
01:40:28,429 --> 01:40:29,430
Ha ha ha!

1180
01:40:36,562 --> 01:40:38,021
Gotta stop...

1181
01:40:39,648 --> 01:40:40,691
stop...

1182
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:42,860
Save your strength.

1183
01:40:43,318 --> 01:40:44,319
Blue.

1184
01:40:45,654 --> 01:40:47,072
You're hypovolemic.

1185
01:40:47,531 --> 01:40:48,824
You're bleeding
to death.

1186
01:40:49,283 --> 01:40:50,868
Need...

1187
01:40:51,326 --> 01:40:52,161
serum.

1188
01:41:10,429 --> 01:41:11,430
Blade.

1189
01:41:13,265 --> 01:41:15,225
Blade.

1190
01:41:17,478 --> 01:41:18,562
Listen to me.

1191
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:22,566
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1192
01:41:24,443 --> 01:41:25,819
No.

1193
01:41:28,155 --> 01:41:29,323
No.

1194
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:32,826
Look, just do it.

1195
01:41:58,519 --> 01:41:59,603
Is everybody thirsty?

1196
01:42:00,062 --> 01:42:03,524
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1197
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:24,211
Ohh...

1198
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:25,754
don’t stop.

1199
01:42:28,924 --> 01:42:30,008
Don’t stop.

1200
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:36,557
Don’t stop.

1201
01:42:51,155 --> 01:42:52,573
Don’t stop.

1202
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:07,504
Aah!

1203
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:46,335
How was it?

1204
01:43:47,628 --> 01:43:48,754
Aah!

1205
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:56,929
Aah!

1206
01:43:57,388 --> 01:43:58,931
Aah!

1207
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:02,142
Aah!

1208
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,817
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1209
01:44:12,486 --> 01:44:14,613
Uhh!

1210
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:23,497
Aah!

1211
01:44:45,686 --> 01:44:47,312
Aah!

1212
01:44:51,567 --> 01:44:52,735
Aah!

1213
01:44:57,364 --> 01:44:58,741
Eric...

1214
01:44:59,825 --> 01:45:01,410
I'm your mother.

1215
01:45:03,662 --> 01:45:06,081
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1216
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,541
would you?

1217
01:45:10,335 --> 01:45:11,336
Come here.

1218
01:45:15,799 --> 01:45:17,968
I must release you.

1219
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:29,980
Fuck!

1220
01:45:31,523 --> 01:45:33,609
Aah!

1221
01:45:48,624 --> 01:45:49,625
Aah!

1222
01:45:56,423 --> 01:45:57,424
Aah!

1223
01:46:27,246 --> 01:46:28,038
Uhh!

1224
01:46:28,497 --> 01:46:29,915
Unh!

1225
01:46:30,374 --> 01:46:31,375
Unh!

1226
01:46:35,003 --> 01:46:35,963
Deacon?

1227
01:46:36,422 --> 01:46:37,589
Not anymore.

1228
01:46:53,522 --> 01:46:55,190
Frost!

1229
01:46:55,649 --> 01:46:56,316
Kill him.

1230
01:46:56,775 --> 01:46:58,402
Wait! I owe you, man.

1231
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:00,320
I got two new hands, Blade.

1232
01:47:00,779 --> 01:47:03,115
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1233
01:47:03,574 --> 01:47:05,034
Aah!

1234
01:47:17,588 --> 01:47:19,757
Yaah!

1235
01:47:23,552 --> 01:47:25,387
Frost.

1236
01:47:27,431 --> 01:47:28,807
Yaah!

1237
01:47:42,404 --> 01:47:44,365
I got struck
by lightning

1238
01:47:45,908 --> 01:47:47,076
Aah!

1239
01:47:47,534 --> 01:47:48,994
Aah!

1240
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:12,684
Aah!

1241
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:49,430
I'm really Going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1242
01:49:14,371 --> 01:49:15,914
Yaah!

1243
01:49:22,129 --> 01:49:23,964
Aah!

1244
01:49:37,978 --> 01:49:39,563
Hey, Blade.

1245
01:49:41,523 --> 01:49:43,484
Let's do this.

1246
01:50:26,568 --> 01:50:28,028
Aah!

1247
01:50:28,487 --> 01:50:30,447
Aah! Aah!

1248
01:50:37,121 --> 01:50:38,872
You're too late, Blade.

1249
01:50:58,434 --> 01:50:59,560
My turn.

1250
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:26,962
Look at you.

1251
01:51:27,421 --> 01:51:28,672
You're a little bitch.

1252
01:51:30,549 --> 01:51:32,051
What, your serum?

1253
01:51:32,509 --> 01:51:34,011
It can't help you
now, stud.

1254
01:51:41,435 --> 01:51:42,478
Nice shot.

1255
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,918
Aah!

1256
01:52:08,212 --> 01:52:09,922
Aah!

1257
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:11,924
Aah! Aah!

1258
01:52:14,718 --> 01:52:15,469
Some motherfuckers

1259
01:52:15,928 --> 01:52:18,847
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1260
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,021
Uhh!

1261
01:52:35,572 --> 01:52:40,577
Aah!

1262
01:52:50,796 --> 01:52:52,339
Blade!

1263
01:53:00,514 --> 01:53:02,433
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:53:38,469 --> 01:53:40,012
I need to get back
to the lab

1265
01:53:40,471 --> 01:53:43,057
if I'm going to cure you.

1266
01:53:43,515 --> 01:53:45,059
It's not over.

1267
01:53:45,517 --> 01:53:46,977
You keep your cure.

1268
01:53:48,103 --> 01:53:49,563
There's still
a war going on,

1269
01:53:50,022 --> 01:53:52,024
and I have a job to do.

1270
01:53:52,483 --> 01:53:54,234
You want to help,

1271
01:53:54,693 --> 01:53:57,029
make me a better serum.

1272
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:52,292
Uhh!
